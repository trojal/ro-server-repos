This branch, "Stable", might not be stable due to bugs and whatsoever. 
It is highly recommended, if you have any dobts on using this svn version,
it is best if you use an eAthena Official Version or use RC5. calling the 
stable branch stable is an understatement. you have choosen to use it,
bear with it.

on another note, if you found a bug, it is best if you report it on the eAthena 
forums as http://eathena.ws/ . If you have made yourself a fix for 
that piece of faulty/buggy code, why not post it up and we'll add it to the svn.
who knows, you might be an aspiring dev.
