AS OF SVN REV. 5091, WE ARE NOW USING TRUNK.  ALL UNTESTED BUGFIXES/FEATURES GO INTO TRUNK.
IF YOU HAVE A WORKING AND TESTED BUGFIX PUT IT INTO STABLE AS WELL AS TRUNK.

2007/04/26
	* Corrected High Jump so it works on Guild Castles when WoE is off.
	* Moonlit petals now always knocks to the back of the character rather than
	  pushing the character away from it's center.
2007/04/25
	* Modified the mob ai think time update after using skills from
	  adelay/amotion to 100ms since the previous method adds a large delay before
	  the AI activates again (which screws up with the timing of idle/walk
	  skills)
	* NPC_MAGICALATTACK now starts a state similar to Sacrificial Ritual, in
	  the sense that every normal attack afterwards becomes a Magical Attack. The
	  skill duration is 15 secs. [Skotlex]
	* Added missing Rachel quest map [Playtester] 
	* Ganbantein now deletes individual skill cells instead of the whole skill
	  in the area it is casted.
	* Modified the mob total damage code to prevent overflows when mobs receive
	  over 2kM damage. [Skotlex]
	* Spider Web / Fiber Lock status cannot be dispelled now [ultramage]
2007/04/24
	* All mob casted skills have a fixed range of 9 now.
	* Pressure no longer vaporizes plants.
2007/04/23
	* Fixed bug which totally broke item group bonuses.
	* Added warnings when setting a pvp/gvg flag removes the other flags on the
	  same map (gvg and pvp can't coexist on the same map)
	* Removed the check that prevented you from casting soul-collect when you
	  already have 5 spirits.
	* Corrected Magic Rod so it doesn't displays any skill-use animation until
	  it triggers.
	* Corrected Steel Body's icon (it actually belongs to AutoBerserk)
	* Debuff on logout&2 is again set to default, instead of removing food
	  bonuses now it removes Maximize Power, Maximum Overthrust and Steel Body.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Extended the functionality of StringBuf - length and appending a string.
	* menu/select/prompt script functions support grouped and empty options.
	  The selected option number is consistent with them.
	* More work on ticket #41. [FlavioJS]
2007/04/22
	* Corrected crash if itemskill is used without an attached player.
	* Removed range checks for autospells as per UltraMage Aegis tests.
	* Added chatID skill fail check to skill_check_condition
	* Corrected @refresh not re-displaying your spirit spheres nor re-setting
	  your cloth dye.
	* Now the "number of attackers" in mob_dead is counted only from online
	  characters on the same map.
	* Updated the autospell bonus scripts so you don't have to specify all the
	  attack type criteria. If neither of BF_LONG/BF_SHORT is specified, the
	  spell will trigger on both. If neither of BF_WEAPON/BF_MAGIC/BF_MISC is
	  specified, the spell will trigger on BF_WEAPON, if neither of
	  BF_NORMAL/BF_SKILL is specified, BF_SKILL is used if the trigger is
	  BF_MAGIC/BF_MISC and BF_NORMAL is used if the attack is BF_WEAPON. This way
	  the default when nothing is specified is
	  BF_NORMAL|BF_WEAPON|BF_SHORT|BF_LONG. [Skotlex]
2007/04/21
	* Removed the +25% mdef, -50% def effect from Freeze status
	* Changed autocast skills, they now only work with normal attacks!
	  Ref: http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=138159
	* Fixed a few spots where attack_type was getting truncated
	* Hopefully fixed the cygwin + size_t problem (using stddef.h as source)
	* Added ntows() to properly handle that client port number deficiency
	* Adjusted the packet_db array for a more consistent look [ultramage]
2007/04/20
	* Cleaned up the doc folder. Removed outdated, untranslated, useless files
	  and began normalizing a bit other ones~ [DracoRPG]
2007/04/18
	* Added MEXP overflow checks. [LuzZza]
	* Added bonus5 bAutoSpell/bAutoSpellWhenHit. The new parameter is used to
	  specify when the spell should trigger (melee/range + weapon/magic/misc
	  attack), see doc/item_bonus.txt for details. [Skotlex]
	* Changed some %lu to %u in login_sql/login.c because uint32 is now 
	  an unsigned int [Toms]
	* Discarded extra deflate function needed for afm reading [ultramage]
	- as a result, discarded the whole chain of support functions, .c files
	  and includes needed to make that one function run
	- also removed zlib compile/link dependencies where they are not needed
	- reduced the whole zlib package into two core include files
	- adjusted makefiles / project files to reflect this change 
2007/04/17
	* Massive at+charcommand cleanup, big thanks to HiddenDragon [DracoRPG]
	* Partially deobfuscated the grfio module
	* Finally fixed mingw problems, managed to build both TXT and SQL
	* Fixed the uint32 platform problem (Microsoft failed so I removed it :)
	* Removed the cbasetypes.h dependency from the mapcache generator
	* Removed some random compilation warnings [ultramage]
	* Small bugfixes and enhancements to the map cache generator [DracoRPG]
2007/04/15
	* Fixed 'randomtarget' picking dead characters.
	* Adjusted Spiral Pierce, Shield Boomerang and Shield Chain to use atk2
	  instead of weight when used by non-players.
	* Adjusted skills blindAttack, SilenceAttack, StunAttack, PetrifyAttack,
	  CurseAttack, SleepAttack, Lex Divina and Dispell to be area effect skills,
	  if the used skill level has a splash-range different from 0.
	* Mob used Meteor Assault is able to hit icewalls now. [Skotlex]
2007/04/15
	* Fixed TXT char creation blocking characters with nonstandard names
2007/04/13
	* Committing some accumulated stuff [ultramage]
	- makefile typo, maps_athena typo, svn:eol-style native for some files
	* Changed the meaning of inf2=0x1000. Now it is used to "disable usage on
	  enemies", which only works for non-aggressive (inf!=1) skills.
	* If a skill is party/guild only (inf2 0x400/0x800) it will also be
	  castable on enemies if the skill's inf is 1 (offensive target)
	* Corrected the mob behaviour when it locks into an enemy it can't chase.
	  Previously it would get stuck on a lock->unlock->lock loop, with each
	  unlock resetting the "random walk" timer, causing the mob to just idle in
	  place. Now they will attempt idle skills and no longer reset the "random
	  walk" timer, so they behave as if they were in Idle state properly.
	* Now the bonus bAtkEle will be transferred directly to the weapon when the
	  script is in the ammunition, and you are wielding a weapon that consumes
	  ammo per atttack.
2007/04/12
	* Trade-requests now fail if the target is in a NPC.
	* Some cleaning of the castend_map code to prevent the menuskill variable
	  from not being cleared if you made a choice but the skill was not triggered
	  (due to silence, stun or whatever)
	* Cleaned up a bit the Charge Attack casttime equation, should prevent
	  infinite casttime when the distance is 0.
2007/04/11
	* Now when an object changes speed, the old move-packet will be used on the
	  next movement, which should update the object's speed from that point and
	  on-wards. This is done since there appears to be no way to tell the client
	  a given object's speed has changed.
	* Modified spirit of Wizard so that the consumption of 'Fragments' when
	  blocking bounced spells will only consume 1 Fragment per skill casted,
	  regardless of how many hits were reflected.
	* Modified status_get_sc_def to handle both rate and tick reductions. This
	  way it can take care of the fact that curse rate/duration reductions are
	  not reduced by the same stats. Curse duration is now reduced by vit.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed an ugly cast in socket.c
	* Fixed Makefile (-Wno-unused-parameter was added twice with gcc4) [Toms]
2007/04/10
	* Recoded and renamed the trim function in strlib to normalize_name.
	* Added a proper trim function to strlib.
	* Cleanups at npc source file adding/removing.
	* Changed db key from 'unsigned char*' to 'const char*'.
	* Defined out the dump function in util.h/c. [FlavioJS]
	* As an experiment Corrected many /W4 warnings on the txt login server
	* Played around with MinGW a bit today... [ultramage]
	- adjusted code so that it handles mingw-specific compatibility problems
	- adjusted the makefile, mingw is not a subset of cygwin
2007/04/09
	* Now when saving a character, only the cart/peco/falcon 'option' states
	  are saved, the rest should be handled by the status change load/save
	  functions. This saves 'permanent' cloaking/hiding and other such oddities
	  if the server is unable to save your status changes on logout.
	* Updated some Guild WoE rules to behave as explained here:
	  http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=146581 [Skotlex]
2007/04/08
	* Fixed the platform-specific stricmp compilation problem
	* Fixed inverted vending tax equation (!) and made it more precise
	* Moved e_mail_check() and config_switch() to strlib.h
	* Synchronized the login servers a bit
2007/04/07
	* Disabled the exception handler on windows debug builds
	* Fixed Devotion using WE_BABY's status icon (now uses no icon);
	  if you have a way to determine the correct number, give feedback
	* Updated the server's PCRE components to 7.0
	- dll, library, header
	- cleaned the only existing example and moved it to /samples
	- changed the interface, now $@ is used instead of $ to store the result
	- /!\ adjust your scripts if you are using npc regexp parsing /!\
	* Fixed the start_point setting smashing t3h stack in some situations
	* Fixed some over/under-dimensioned arrays (defines already cover the '\0')
	* Fixed an unupdated define making Warp Portal fail with an error [ultramage]
	* Final touches to the whole map crap [DracoRPG]
	- changed MAP_NAME_LENGTH to 12, now there's MAP_NAME_LENGTH_EXT at 16 for
	  uses where there is / may be the .gat extension, code adjusted accordingly
	- moved map_normalize_name to mapindex_normalize_name so that everything
	  handling map names uses the same extension-removing function
	- greatly enhanced the map cache generator, complete documentation on the
	  tool and the map cache format can be found in doc/
	- the map cache format changed a bit as a consequence, but of course a new
	  valid one is included (contains latest Nameless Island maps)
	- and I'm sorry for the number of times I've moved around and renamed files,
	  now the final structure should have been reached
	* Capped clif_heal's heal field (the argument received is int, but the
	  packet field is short, meaning that if the heal is high enough, the client
	  would receive a negative heal amount). [Skotlex]
2007/04/06
	* Made a crazy attempt to at least partially synchronize login&char code
	* Major edit to the way the servers handle ip addresses, making them obey
	  the "host byte order inside, network byte order outside" rule [ultramage]
	- hopefully covered all entry- and exit-points for IP address data
	- discovered several places where Gravity's client breaks the convention,
	  will need to come up with a suitable countermeasure for that
	- other than that, the code should be portable, except for printing and
	  ipban mask testing (those still assume a specific byte order)
	- tested both txt and sql in all usual situations; tested single- and
	  multi-server setups, all seems to work (but watch out for hidden bugs!)
2007/04/05
	* Cleaned @whogm. It will display the name of all gms online. If their GM
	  level is above your own, it will only display their name, otherwise level,
	  position, and party/guild info is displayed. GM's using gm-hide will not
	  appear on this list.
	* Corrected song/dances/encores reducing SP at the incorrect intervals
	  (either never, or every second).
2007/04/04
	* Corrected Longing for Freedom, it should triple SP cost rather than
	  modifying SP cost to 1/sec
	* SC_ENCHANTARMS will no longer fail to start if it's already running with
	  a "higher elemental level".
	* When trying to trade an untradeable item, the add-item-fail packet will
	  be sent so the client does not gets stuck. [Skotlex]
2007/04/03
	* Some spring-cleaning in sql-files, only left SVN 8k+ files [DracoRPG]
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Fixed char-server crash on @changegm use.
	* Cleaned up mmo_auth, this function wasn't only poorly coded, it also had
	  a SQL-related memory leak in it!
	* Corrected the attack_attr_none check being backwards (ie: this config was
	  working backwards!)
	* All pets can now move regardless of their Mob counter part setting.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some source code cleaning
	- Fixed the badly worded messages during mapserver startup
	- Cleaned up socket config reading
	- Split resolve_hostbyname() into 2 separate functions for clarity
	- Moved the probably obsolete LOWER/UPPER macros to db.c (TODO: remove)
	- Moved the badly placed compare_item() function to storage.c (see r779)
	* Fully removed the msvcr80.dll dependency from the vs8 project files
2007/04/02
	* Removed some overly verbose item group messages & code
	* re-added the item_group_list for consistency's sake, moved to itemdb.h
	  (after some hacking to remove the ugly map.h dependency)
	* Fixed the server crashing on a timer-queued disguise / undisguise
	* Fixed the server crashing on startup due to bad define [ultramage]
	* Removed bonus 'bAspdAddRate'. bAspdRate now behaves on a stackable
	  matter, so it's no longer needed.
	* Reimplemented the bonus 'bAspd' (raw Aspd increase) [Skotlex]
2007/03/31
	* Added all the missing defines for ctype.h functions and converted all 
	  the direct uses to the defines. [FlavioJS]
2007/03/30
	* Added "do_abort" function to the core. It is invoked when the server has
	  received a Segmentation Fault or Floating Point Exception signal. Currently
	  the only one that uses it is the map-server, which then attempts to save
	  all online characters before aborting. Note that due to the current
	  coding of the sig plugin, do_abort will not be invoked if you use it!
	  This plugin needs to be updated... [Skotlex]
	* Continued script.c cleanup [Toms]
2007/03/29
	* Corrected OPTION_XMAS since 2007 clients have split it up from
	  OPTION_FLYING (on previous clients both were the same option value).
	* Corrected statp array not being long enough to actually hold the status
	  points of ALL levels up to and including MAX_LEVEL. Fixes reaching final
	  level and resetting giving you an unpredictable amount of status points.
2007/03/28
	* Negative aspd rate bonuses will be handled as aspd add rate since the
	  default non-stackable bonus is useless on penalty bonuses.
	* Added check to prevent the client from using passive skills. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files [Playtester]
	* Removed a missing file reference in the athena-start script
	* Fixed a #error "<malloc.h> has been replaced by <stdlib.h>" problem
	* Fixed the msg_silent setting not being announced every time [ultramage]
2007/03/27
	* Cleaned up some the mob skill use code. The skill re-use delay is set at
	  the time the skill is used rather than when it finishes casting. The
	  invalid target check was also moved to the mob skill db reading function.
	* Skills can be used now when the autoskill menu is open (since there's no
	  packet sent by the client when you hit on cancel). [Skotlex]
	* Added some svn:ignore properties [Toms]
	* Solved console plugins compilation error [Toms]
	* Changed MAX_LEVEL to the standard value 99. Memory consumption-= 55MB.
	- !!!WARNING!!! If your server uses higher levels, be sure to adjust
	  this appropriately! (the define can be found in /src/map/map.h)
	* Corrected SC_COMA's success chance (X.4 says it's unconditional 100%)
	* Changed the vs8 used crt library to static linking [ultramage]
2007/03/26
	* Coma now reduces SP to 0 (with the exception of Dark Blessing) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected "format '%lu' expects type 'long unsigned int', but argument 4 
	  has type 'unsigned int'" warning on login.sql [Toms]
2007/03/24
	* Corrected change r10051 which prevented Ice Pick from working [ultramage]
	- the 'ignore_' variables are bitflags and therefore need enough bits
	  to store all info; 8 bits wasn't enough in this case
2007/03/23
	* Major reconfiguration of the vs7 project files (+vs8 while I was at it)
	- added definitions _DEBUG and NDEBUG to tune system-specific stuff
	- reduced the build requirements (Pentium 4 was a bit too much)
	- changed build settings and project structure to match the vs8 projects
	- corrected some vs8 inconsistencies
	* Some generic typo fixes [ultramage]
	* Corrected Ankle Snare/Spider Web having a 1% chance to trap rather than
	  100%
	* Food boosts are now dispelled on death only.
2007/03/22
	* Corrected setitemscript not correctly updating the item's script.
	* Added define MAX_CHARS so you can easily mod the server to support a
	  different amount of characters per account (however, there is still the
	  issue of hexing the client to support this change)
	* Updated msg_athena.conf so it no longer uses broken english on several
	  entries. Thanks to Scerez for the updated file.
2007/03/21
	* getpetinfo 5 will now return the pet's rename flag.
	* Autoloot will now only work on items dropped a certain distance from the
	  player. The distance is defined by AUTOLOOT_DISTANCE in atcommand.h and
	  defaults to AREA_SIZE.
	* Removed Magic Rod's cast bar.
	* Gravitation no longer causes damage flinch. [Skotlex]
2007/03/20
	* Increased MAX_STATUSCHANGE to 300 to make room for new statuses [DracoRPG]
	* Reverted mapindex reading from map_list.txt for the map-server [DracoRPG]
	* Patched the MAX_STATUSCHANGE startup error [ultramage
	* Removed the last argument from script command skillitem.
	* Added skill ITEM_ENCHANTARMS, this is what weapon enchanting items should
	  use.
	* Added support for specifying different elements per skill level in the
	  skill_db
	* Added bonus bNoKnockback.
	* Corrected login sql server not reseting your account state to 0 when the
	  banuntil duration expires.
	* Made the skillatk bonus it's own function, it can now be used to boost
	  Heal/Sanctuary/Potion Pitcher and Slim Pitcher as well.
	* Corrected Teleport's save map entry being sent without the .gat
	  extension.
	* Corrected Warp Portal not sending the map names with the .gat extension.
	* Probably corrected Disarm's strip animation.
2007/03/19
	* Rewrote the jail logic to always use a status change. This means that the
	  character's save point is not changed when jailed, and the char is always
	  warped back to the point where it was before being jailed on unjail.
	* Modified @adjcmdlvl so you can't set a command to require higher level
	  than yourself, and so you can't edit the level of a command which is higher
	  than your own.
	* Corrected attack_attr_none setting disabling elemental resist cards.
	* Corrected Dispell removing Jailed status.
	* Corrected being able to revive with 0 hp.
	* Modified the "Restart" code so that it makes you stand on spot when
	  pc_setpos fails to move you back to your originating location. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some wrong sql login logic
	* Fixed some compiler warnings, cleaned up mapserver sql-related vars
	* Removed the old 'mapserver charsave' mechanism [ultramage]
	* Globalised use of script_pushint and script_getdata in script.c
	  If someone need them, the regexp used was : 
	  sed -i "s/& *(st->stack->stack_data\[st->start *+ *\([^]]*\)\])/script_getdata(st,\1)/g" script.c
	  sed -i "s/push_val(st->stack, *C_INT *, *\([^)]*\))/script_pushint(st,\1)/g" script.c
	* Little clean of unused variables in script.c [Toms]
	* Script engine:
	- calling functions without using the return value doesn't generate warnings
	- more work on Ticket #41
	* Took care of two warnings and a minor change to the makefile. [FlavioJS]
2007/03/18
	* Added missing VC++ 7.1 project files for mapcache. [Lance]
	* A followup to the login_sql server changes:
	  Due to a missing 'else' in the case_sensitive config setting loading
	  code (see r483 and r3316), the option was always being set to 'off'.
	  Now that I have corrected it, make sure to set it exactly how you
	  want it to behave (usually case-insensitive)!
	  Failure to do so can result in half the server spamming you with
	  messages about how they are getting 'unregistered id' errors.
2007/03/17
	* committing my work on the login server (mostly SQL) [ultramage]
	- removed the check_ip_flag from login&char (there since r1)
	- removed the CMP_AUTHFIFO_IP and CMP_AUTHFIFO_LOGIN2 defines (also r1)
	- removed dynamic_account_ban, gm_db settings, weren't doing anything at all
	- modified the date_format setting to take the format string directly
	- removed overly verbose config loading messages
	- removed/simplified many more useless actions
	- renamed the dynamic_pass_failure_ban_ settings to make more sense
	- collected relevant config settings into a login_config structure
	  and documented their purpose
	- allowed usage of yes/no instead of the user-unfriendly 1/0 method
	  in config settings (and added 1/0 as a possible option)
	- fixed dnsbl which was always taking only the first entry into account
2007/03/16
	* Corrected the structure and added info on the skill fail packet (0x110).
	* Added packet 0x223 as clif_upgrademessage (not used yet).
	* More work on Ticket #41. [FlavioJS]
2007/03/15
	* Added SC_CHANGEUNDEAD to differentiate it from the other elemental change
	  skills. It now fails on Undead/Dark elemental targets.
	* Corrected party item share settings not being properly updated on logon.
	* Corrected battle_attr_none setting applying to elemental attacks instead
	  of neutral ones. [Skotlex]
2007/03/14
	* Finished polishing the new mapcache system [DracoRPG]
	- common/grfio.* now empty except zipping functions (to read mapcache)
	- servers do not use .gat internally anymore
	 => YOU CAN (and should) STOP USING .gat IN YOUR SCRIPTS
	- moved files for the mapcache builder to db/ for now
	- the char-server now uses the same index list as the mapcache builder
	 => poring_c01, poring_c02 and ng_quest mapindex have changed, beware
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Adjusted @pvpoff, @gvgoff, @killer, @killable to make characters stop
	  attacking when used.
	* Dispell no longer removes food boosts.
	* Players will stop attacking when they change their look.
	* Applied Alydis's fix to the mvp item logs logging mvp items even if the
	  player couldn't get the item.
2007/03/13
	* Corrected the new packet version entries for skilluseposinfo
	* Corrected item reloading not unsetting the "delay consume" flag if the
	  item had changed it's type.
	* the Attack_Type variable in skill_attack now inherits the damage.flag
	  properties, this fixes ranged status effects not triggering.
2007/03/12
	* Added player not attached crash prevention to countitem/countitem2.
	* Probably corrected delitem not deleting pet eggs at all.
	* Hopefully fixed hidenpc/disablenpc not working on Guild flag sprites.
	* Mob skill state "anytarget" no longer triggers when the mob has an
	  item-target (looting).
	* @storage/@gstorage will no longer work if you have a trade or a storage
	  opened already.
	* Corrected script command movenpc so it properly moves the ontouch npc
	  cells as well.
	* Changed the unit-walk packet to be 0x86 as pointed out by FlavioJS. This
	  new packet is much smaller, and should greatly decrease bandwidth usage.
	  The only drawback is that the character will not display at all if the
	  client didn't know of it's existance previously, but eA should always be
	  sending a spawn packet when an object gets into/out of sight anyway, so
	  it should work correctly.
	* Modified the guild master change ack packet to return the aid/cid of the
	  new guild master instead of the index where it was, the previous method
	  could cause problems in situations where the order of guild members would
	  not match exactly between char/map servers.
	* Updated the Soul Linker's Rogue Spirit Stealth's speed bonus to +60%,
	  according to forum infor from ragnagate. [Skotlex]
2007/03/09
	* Mapcache can run on system with any endianness.
	  The generated file contains data in little endian.
	* Added info on packet 0x86 (simple move packet). Not usable until a clear 
	  separation between entering sight/leaving sight/walking in sight is done.
	* Propagating const char* from the script engine.
	* ".gat" is appended to the map name before sending the changemapserver
	  packet to the client. [FlavioJS]
	* Normalized the mapname in guild get/set castle data, should fix guild
	  flags.
	* Added log options 0x800/0x1000 to log storage moves ('R') and guild
	  storage moves ('G')
	* Added upgrade_svn9976.sql to include 'R'/'G' on the picklog type column
	  set.
	* Updated the logs_athena description to include the letter of each type
	  (512 - M, 32 - N, etc)
2007/03/08
	* Corrected the pet/homunc data not being free'd if the player logs out
	  before being authed.
	* Initialized player's speed on pc_setnewpc to prevent homunculus copying a
	  speed of 0.
	* Corrected ranged add-status only triggering if the attack is arrow
	  based.
	* Updated counter add-status so they trigger on ranged attacks instead of
	  using "arrow_atk" state. [Skotlex]
	* Here comes the new mapcache system! [DracoRPG]
	- The last and only big "feature" (kind of cleanup in fact) you'll see
	- Totally removes GRF/GAT handling from map-server that only reads from cache
	- The cache now also contains map indexes, and is mostly zipped (1.5MB atm)
	- It is shipped with eA => 100% client-independant, no more missing maps
	- If you want to add custom maps, the mapcache builder is available, doc
	  and Unix Makefile coming as soon as possible (VC8 project only ATM :/)
	- Removed now useless AFM/AF2 support, as well as the startup screen notice
2007/03/07
	* Corrected the define for NK no cardfix (def).
	* Fixed the char sql server not escaping the server name before inserting
	  it on the ragsrvinfo table.
	* Corrected @lvup not doing the party even share check.
	* Corrected breaker's misc part not ignoring element.
2007/03/06
	* Added NK value 0x80: ignore target's cards (0x8 will now only ignore
	  attacker's cards).
	* Corrected Soul Breaker ignoring target's cards instead of the caster's.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed an infinite loop if script name contains a single ':' [Toms]
	* Simplified the Utsusemi/Bunsinjyutsu check to only block weapon skills
	  that do not ignore offensive cards. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for the 2 new packet versions. [Zephiris]
	* Fixed the loginlog's `user` column length (use upgrade_svn9957.sql)
2007/03/05
	* More tweaks to socket.c to simplify the code [ultramage]
	- many generic cleanups - reformatting, useless code removal, etc
	- made the mode_neg setting a compile-time decision, not a run-time one
	- removed the silly frame_size setting (there since r1)
	- added some TODOs to http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=127988
	* Added the +20hit that were missing the NPC elemental attack skills.
	* Added support for autospells using "a random skill level". The last value
	  of bonus4 bAutoSpell is used for determining this as well as the target. &1
	  is to cast on target (otherwise cast on self), and &2 is to use a random
	  level UP to the level specified in the script (otherwise always cast the
	  specified level)
	* Updated item_bonus.txt with the documentation for the
	  bAutoSpell/bAutoSpellWhenHit changes.
	* Corrected @refresh not reupdating the basic stat bonuses.
2007/03/03
	* Modified a bit the storm gust counter code to see if it fixes storm gusts
	  sometimes freezing on first hit.
2007/03/02
	* Tatami Gaeshi state (proyectile blocking) now ends when you move.
	* SG Union will consume now SP if you use it while not soul linked.
	* Added variable "skip" to the mob spawn data, to know how many mobs to
	  skip when spawning because they were not removed due to the
	  "mob_remove_damaged" setting.
	* Corrected the Hp/Sp regen formulas from Hp/Sp/Spirit Recovery and
	  Happy/Peaceful break according to recent forums discussions (formula is
	  changed from x*lv +max*lv/500 to lv*(x+max/500). [Skotlex]
	* Added new script function: setiteminfo. Now you can make custom items [Lupus]
	- Updated script function setitemscript(itemID,script,WhichScript)
		now u can set one of 3 item scripts: use/update, equip, unequip
		But it works only if the original item had 3 non empty scriptsin ITEM_DB
		can't fix this issue yet
		1201,Knife,Knife,4,50,,400,17,,1,3,0xFE9F7EEF,7,2,2,1,1,1,1,{dispbottom "1";},{dispbottom "2";},{dispbottom "3";}
		and... if u've used this function, later @reloaditemdb may crush the map server ^_-
	- Check npc/sample/npc_test_setitemx.txt as example of setiteminfo & setitemscript
2007/03/01
	* Corrected raid not doing the "can hit?" check on splash area targets.
	* Fixed the definition of warpwaitingpc so that it allows an optional
	  argument (number of people to warp).
	* Modified the Palm Strike packet so the initial hit animation does not
	  displays "Miss".
	* Added a check to prevent trades from being commited if either character
	  is in final-save state.
	* Checked and cleaned up the online_check code in the char-server. Further
	  connections to the char-server are rejected when the account already has a
	  connection (previously this would happen only if there was already another
	  character IN game, not just waiting on the char-select screen). [Skotlex]
2007/02/28
	* Added the source and VC8 project for my experimental mapcache generator;
	  it is NOT compatible with eA's current mapcache but uses a brand new format
	  that I still have to embed into the map-server [DracoRPG]
2007/02/27
	* NPC_AGIUP now boosts flee by 100% and duration is 5+5*lv secs, as stated
	  on the Ragnarok Bible.
	* Fixed Soul Breaker's misc part not ignoring flee.
	* Fixed misc attack's flee check being backwards (the less hit%, the more
	  chance you had to connect)
	* Corrected the range check in vending.c [Skotlex]
	* Added map & distance check to vending to prevent WPE hacks. [Lupus]
		E.g. buying items from WoE castle
	* Fixed a compiler warning in char_sql\login.c
	* Minor source documentation/cleanup. [FlavioJS]
2007/02/26
	* You are allowed to expel guild mates that are not online now.
	* Corrected damage of BloodDrain
	* Moved the "already connected" checks to pc_authok, since a dual login
	  doesn't needs to be checked until the new connection is accepted.
	* You are allowed to attack/use skills now when your cloaking level is
	  below 3.
	* Small change to Stone Curse that may fix the permanent "semi-stone"
	  status.
	* Corrected "taming monster" having your skill-use be stuck if you cancel
	  the target selection process.
	* config setting party_show_share_picker now displays the jname of the item
	  picked as well.
	* Corrected some typos and small details
	  (forgotten bInfiniteEndure [r6487], mysterious '1' in help file, etc)
2007/02/25
	* Added Krade's makefile fix for 64bit compilers [ultramage]
	- ref: http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=136622
	* Minor cleanup/documentation on the script engine. [FlavioJS]
2007/02/24
	* Fixed the mob_override_name setting not working on summoned mobs.
	* The server now prints an error message when it the produce_db reaches the
	  max number of allowed produce recipes.
	* The NK value of the skill_db has been made a hexadecimal value, and
	  expanded to include more information about a skill's damage properties: 0x8
	  ignore caster's cards, 0x10 ignore element adjustments, 0x20 ignore
	  target's defense, 0x40 ignore target's flee. Note that magic attacks
	  always ignore flee, and misc attacks always ignore defense.
	* Autoguard will no longer work on skills that don't take in card
	  adjustments
	* utsusemi & bunsinjyutsu no longer work on skills that don't take in card
	  adjustments.
	* Corrected damage of the NPC elemental attack skills, Blood Drain and
	  Energy Drain
	* Adjusted menu-based skills so you can't reuse the same skill until you've
	  dealt with the menu.
	* Adjust autospells so that removing an autospell works when the script of
	  the card that removes the autospell is triggered before the script that
	  adds the spell.
	* The "requested name of gm-hidden char" warning will not be displayed when
	  the object in question is an NPC (since you can use Intravision to do
	  this).
	* Venom Knife no longer takes into accounts cards or EDP.
2007/02/23
	* Guild expulsion now will fail when the character to be kicked is in a
	  guild castle (rather than checking for the character doing the expulsion)
	* pk damage reduction settings now will take effect only on Player VS
	  player damage.
	* Fixed produce_db2.txt entries overwriting produce_db.txt ones.
	* Fixed item-granted/plagiarized skills unlocking skill trees when only
	  your real learned level should. [Skotlex]
2007/02/21
	* Applied a consistent look to all header files (copyright, ifdefs)
	* Minor stuff (typos, socket.c, junk in login reply packet) [ultramage]
2007/02/19
	* Fixed @cartlist info message typo [Lupus]
2007/02/17
	* Fixed a typo from r9778, allowing non-gm chars to use /kill [ultramage]
2007/02/16
	* Fixed the structure of packet 0x6d (new char info). It's the same as the 
	  one used for packet 0x6b (chars info). [FlavioJS]
	* Updated script commands startnpctimer, stopnpctimer, initnpctimer so you
	  can attach a player to them, this is done because the attach/detach
	  functions can't be used to attach to a different script than the one
	  currently running.
	* Updated the script_command reference with the new flag values of
	  [start/stop/init]npctimer.
	* Modified the "guardian" spawn script command, it no longer receives a
	  "amount" argument (since that only leads to trouble), if the class is
	  negative, it'll pick a random class the same way the monster spawn script
	  command does, and if you pass a spawn position with coordinates equal or
	  less to 0, a random spot in the map will be taken. However you can't use
	  "this" as a map name anymore since these script commands do not need an
	  attached player.
	* Guardian spawning will now fail if you attempt to spawn a guardian that
	  already exists on the same position.
	* Miracle of the Sun, Moon and Stars can now retrigger to lenghten it's
	  effect, and it is cancelled on warp/map-change. [Skotlex]
2007/02/15
	* Reverted some of my mobdb code
	* Cleaned up clif_party_info a bit
	* Cleaned up set_reg (the same procedure as get_val) [ultramage]
	* The default packet version is now 8. Clients from November2006 and before
	  can no longer get past the char-server unless you change it back to 7.
	* Fixed Storm Gust counter freezing on fourth hit instead of third.
	* Fixed @homstats not taking into consideration that the stat growth
	  decimals get discarded on level up (so the real minimum/maximum displayed
	  was off).
2007/02/13
	* Applied Rayce's dangling pointer fix when returning a temporary npc
	  string variable (those starting with .@)
	* Required Weapon, ammo, and skill state are now only checked on begin
	  casting, instead of both on begin and end casting.
2007/02/12
	* Fixed Resurrect Homunculus and Wedding skills failing. [Skotlex]
	* A bit more work on Ticket #41.
	* Added 'r' (variable reference) to the script argument definitions.
	* Added a simple define for suspitious actions. (empty at the moment)
	* Added clif_clearcart and moved sending cart packets to pc_setoption.
	* clif_parse_ChangeCart checking the player level. [FlavioJS]
	* Fixed clif_parse_GMmessage cutting off messages randomly [ultramage]
	  (due to a typo in revision r9778)
	* Fixed Wand of Hermod
	* Corrected Spider Web casting around caster instead of target's position.
	* Corrected a possible crash during login due to checking for the incorrect
	  variable (lets pc_calc_status be invoked when it shouldn't)
	* Added bounds checking to map_foreachincell.
	* Opt2 values (poison, blind, and so on) are now resent on warp/map-change.
	* Corrected description of isloggedin script command. [Skotlex]
2007/02/11
	* Fixed the inverted behavior of display_skill_fail, caused by r9823
	* Fixed @loadnpc not updating the script_event[] array
2007/02/10
	* Fixed clif_party_message using an incorrect buffer length [ultramage]
	* Cosmetic changes to the buildin section of script.c (use defines for 
	  function names/definitions). [FlavioJS]
2007/02/09
	* Updated the 'unit walk' to functions so they stop your attack if it's
	  possible to walk.
	* Fixed char server SQL not sending the guild info update to other map
	  servers when a new member is added.
2007/02/08
	* Modified Spider Web so it can instantly retrap a target, rather than
	  idling on the ground waiting for a new target.
	* Cleaned up some the rude-attacked code, being attacked while under spider
	  web now triggers rude-attacked. [Skotlex]
	* Added code for SQL that will automatically detect the ping interval
	  at startup, and copy-pasted it around the code; removed the conf setting
	* Added a missing null pointer check in clif_parse_globalmessage
	* Fixed the new socket code, which was triggering the inactivity timeout
	  on the servers' listening sockets
	* Fixed the TURBO code not working since r4468 (parse func never called)
2007/02/07
	* More aggressive cleaning up of the socket code [ultramage]
	- removed unused session_data2 entry in sd
	- added a new create_session() function, helps keep things cleaner
	  (although it's ad-hoc and not perfect, since this is C)
	- undid r4978 since it was getting in the way (re-add it if you need it)
	- added defines for the recv, send and parse func pointers
	- added null functions for the three actions, and made create_session()
	  calls use those instead of NULL pointers; insignificant penalty and now:
	- since all three funcs are always initialized, removed all those NULL checks 
	- removed the efd set, since as the people from the developernet forums
	  pointed out, it's only for out-of-band data and NOT for error checking
	  (in fact, select() bails out without giving any info if it errors out)
	- reorganized the randomly placed socket.c contents somewhat
	- it'll be a miracle if this works like it should ^^;
	* Modified spider web so that the skill_unit_db flag restrictions may take
	  place. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaning up of the socket code [ultramage]
	- Shuffled includes around for files that were leeching off of socket.h
	- Added code that enforces standard shutdown behavior for sockets
	- Wiped out the poorly written parse code from r2211
	* Removed old script bonuses bMatk, bMatk1, bMatk2.
	* Fixed char-server not sending online notification when a party member
	  logs in.
	* When skill range by distance is set, the distance checked for is now 5
	  cells rather than 3.
	* Fixed bMatkRate bonuses not applying to status earned modifications to
	  int/matk. [Skotlex]
	* Removed deprecated console code.
	* Moved CHAT_SIZE back to map.h because log_atcommand uses it on sql 
	  builds. (moved to clif.c in r9811) [FlavioJS]
2007/02/06
	* Cleaned up the script engine's get_val() function [ultramage]
	- changed the long if-spaghetti into a compact switch statement
	- changed its behavior so that it exits if !sd and it requires one
	- upon exiting, it will now ensure that meaningful values get returned
	  (the old code had no qualms about returning random junk from memory
	   for integer queries, and crashing for string queries)
	- removed many !sd checks since they are done at the beginning now
	* Fixed #lvup having the gm level check backwards.
	* Fixed the stormgust freeze counter going up even if the attack is
	  blocked/cancelled.
	* Cleaned up homunc attack request parsing. Homunculus no longer goes into
	  auto-attack (ctrl+click) mode since the client does every attack request
	  individually.
	* Fixed char-server not sending party status update when a member logs
	  on/off.
	* Fixed crash when parsing guild member information change from the
	  char-server if the specified character is not found in the guild.
	* Fixed MvP mobs giving exp when killed even if they shouldn't.
2007/02/05
	* Fixed @lvup, #lvup not doing a stat reset and lowering your status points
	  if you had 0 status points at that time.
	* Fixed MvP exp and item rewards being given even when the mob_dead flag
	  specifies you should not receive exp or items.
	* Updated the code so that now a range of a skill is determined by the
	  skill's range in the db. Now only skills with less than 5 cells of range
	  are melee.
	* The inf2 parameter of the skill_db is now red as an hexadecimal.
	* The super novice self-revive angel will now trigger only once per
	  session, if you relog you can have it trigger again. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the skill tree not always updating when using @allskill
	* Probably fixed the target-change on melee attack setting not working.
	* Moved the deletion of the invincible timer when using skills so that it
	  is not deleted for skills such as Ashura (when just selecting a target)
	  [Skotlex]
2007/02/03
	* Continuing the checking of script buildin functions and stop the script 
	  execution when an attached player is required but not found.
	  This task will be referenced as Ticket #41 from now on. [FlavioJS]
	* Updated the TXT login server's account id checker
	  (it was still saying the minimum is 700000 instead of 2000000)
	* Changed the 'getpartyleader' script command so that it returns a map
	  name instead of the useless mapindex number. Also fixed it so that it
	  doesn't throw a 'args of aFree is not valid pointer' error.
	  (although I'm not at all sure that the fix is correct)
	  Ref: http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=137274
	* Removed the silly and misleading 'firewall detected' message
	* Added missing vc6 project file
	* Corrected a lie in the script documentation [ultramage]
2007/02/02
	* Fixed the flag parameter not working on npcshopattach.
	* Updated the walk delay code so that it parses homunculus as well as
	  players. What this means is that a homunculus walk request won't go ignored
	  if it's issued during the 'can't walk delay' after being hit.
	* Added a possible crash protection in clif_skillfail when the player is
	  without a connection. [Skotlex]
	* Fine-tuned the global message processing function [ultramage]
	- now detects access-out-of-rfifo attempts (idea from eA++)
	- uses the new CHAT_SIZE define to restrict message lengths
	- detects Frost Joke/Dazzler and gives them more freedom (from Freya)
	- more strict non-conformant message detection 
	- logging every problem to the mapserver console
	* Resetting skills will now automatically remove peco, falcon, cart and
	  homunculus (vaporize).
	* Fixed random mob picking choosing clones.
	* Fixed critical spots that could be exploited [Skotlex]
	- The define MESSAGE_SIZE was wrong! It is only used for input boxes.
	  Therefore now it is only used for Vending, Talkie box and Graffiti
	- Added new define CHAT_SIZE which holds the max length that a client
	  can send from the chat buffer
	- Added define msg_len_check which crops incoming client text if it's
	  longer than CHAT_SIZE. Added cropping to all incoming messages except
	  normal chatting which is already accounted for.
	- Removed variable talkie_mes, this is now handled by sd->message
	- Cleaned up parser functions for /b /lb, gm kick, /shift, /recall
	- Added crash protection to the logging functions when they receive
	  a too long string.
2007/02/01
	* Restricted global messages to 255 characters (client shows only ~80 anyway,
	  wanted to use 127 but frost joke's lines are longer than that ...)
	- prevented using a ~22+kB long message to crash everyone on screen
	- prevented faking the message length to cause an out-of-bounds access crash
	- removed the unneccessary 'buf'ffer (inspiration from jAthena)
	- Ref: http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=137770
	* Corrected the chat system to allow 8-letter passwords
	* Minor details (pdb file location, improved debug, npc typo) [ultramage]
	* Cleaned up the npcshop(add/del)item script commands, fixed a possible
	  dangling pointer crash caused by their improper use of realloc. They no
	  longer automatically attach the script to the shop, and they will return
	  true/false based on whether the shop was found or not.
	* Added script command npcshopattach to enable attaching/detaching your
	  script from any npc shop.
	* Updated doc/script_commands.txt with entries for npcshopitem,
	  npcshopadditem, npcshopdelitem and npcshopattach [Skotlex]
	* A followup to r9761, a header include that somehow didn't commit [ultramage]
	* Item search is now a bit smarter. When no item is found with the same
	  'aegis name', then the 'normal' name is used instead.
	* Updated the @/# commands that take an item name so that you can use
	  quotes when specifying item names with spaces in them. For example, @item
	  "poring card" 1 will work now. Note that only the commands that work on ONE
	  item have been updated, those that do an item list need to be updated as
	  well. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the old vs6 files to latest, thanks to k3dt for contributing them
	* Reorganized the vs6 project files (update will follow)
	* Fixed an accidental change in r9758 (edit&continue) [ultramage]
	* Added support for mob skill target 'randomtarget', when specified, it
	  will pick a random enemy from within the skill's cast range. [Skotlex]
	* Added string function strnlen [ultramage]
	- This thing is useful for removing potential out-of-bounds crashes.
	  Had to #ifdef it because some systems implement it, some don't provide
	  the header, and some don't have it at all. Adjust/improve as neccessary.
	* Corrected homunculus's aspd being halved after using some aspd adjusting
	  skill.
	* Removed the log info message 'created homunc...', and the 'loaded homunc'
	  message will only show if the save_log is enabled.
	* When when a party-member levels up, the level change is sent to the
	  char-server to update the even-share range values.
	* When joining a gvg_dungeon, the pvp packet will be sent to signal
	  versus. With this gvg dungeons should be working correctly now. [Skotlex]
2007/01/31
	* Changes in the VS8 project files: [FlavioJS]
	- synchronized the settings between the projects
	- joined all .h and .cpp files and grouped them based on the src subfolder
	- added Debug/Release build targets that build txt/sql only
	- other minor changes
	* Removed graph, httpd and webserver
	* Wiped out the old night code (use svn if you want it) [ultramage]
2007/01/30
	* 'Long Range Attacked' mob skill conditions will no longer trigger on
	  magic attacks.
	* Corrected char deletion not working (column is called homun_id, not
	  hom_id...)
	* Collapsed config settings produce_item_name_input,
	  produce_potion_name_input, making_arrow_name_input, holywater_name_input,
	  cdp_name_input into a single config produce_item_name_input which uses
	  bitmasks to determine what it affects.
	* Updated arrow_decrement to have 3 possible values: Disabled, Enabled, and
	  Enabled + Autoguess (gives arrow consumption as appropiate to
	  plagiarized/acquired skills).
2007/01/29
	* Corrected the homunculus deletion functions so that the homunculus is
	  deleted together with the character.
	* Added npc_check_areanpc so that Wand of Hermod will correctly check for
	  nearby warps.
	* Emergency avoid now stacks with other speed boost statuses
	* Item skills and skills that bring up a menu now are cleared on death.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added a nasty hack to prevent multilanguage clients from breaking guild notices
2007/01/27
	* Made @reloadscript wipe ALL previous mobs that the script engine spawned
	- this way it is manageable via global vars; the other way doesn't allow that
	* Some misc cleanups (typos, formatting, forgotten changelog entry etc)
	* Reformatted and translated atcommand.c
	- in the process improved @marry, allowing spaces after the first comma
	* Simple cleanup
	- removed atcommands @w, @server_date/time, @red, @happyhappyjoyjoy, @shuffle
	- synced gm level of @jailfor, @charjailtime, @npcmove, @chardropall,
	  @charstoreall, @send, @mute, @changelook, @exp and @nuke
	- added conf entries for @whozeny, @kamic, @tonpc, @petid, @identify, @adopt,
	  @trade, @changelook, @send
	- reorganized the atcommand_athena.conf file a bit
	* Corrected indentation of the atcommand table (editor compatibility)
	* BEGIN atcommand cleanup process
	  (according to http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=111996)
	* Fixed a C language restriction preventing compilation [ultramage]
2007/01/26
	* Removed all those useless read-from-GRF features noone would ever use,
	  also removed cutincard script command as a consequence [DracoRPG]
	  - this is only the beginning of full grfio disparition from map-server
	* Now assassins can equip arrows, and status arrows trigger on any ranged
	  physical attack: mimics Grimtooth + status arrow "Aegis bug" [DracoRPG]
	* Added some random Storage Password packets thingies [DracoRPG]
	* Kaite and Assumptio no longer stack. One will remove the other in the
	  same way Assumptio and Kyrie do.
	* Made homunculus renaming go through the char-server so it can be
	  validated against the allowed characters setting.
	* Added battle config hom_rename so you can enable renaming multiple times
	  your homunc.
	* Fixed the normalizing function not sending first classes back to novice
	  if they do not have basic skill maxed.
	* Added a wrapper to delete_timer so it prints out from where the
	  invocation was done.
	* Fixed Splash attacks consuming 2 ammo on each attack. [Skotlex]
	* Added some more freedom for the txt log paths since 32 wasn't enough
	* Removed log_uptime that was accidentally introduced in r1208 [ultramage]
2007/01/24
	* Cleaned up some more the Joint Beat implementation, so the status don't
	  take effect until the attack connects. [Skotlex]
2007/01/23
	* Fixed int/dex foods using an incorrect icon for their status [ultramage]
	* Changed the night status from 149 to 160, which seems to work so much
	  better, and also enabled simplifying the night code.
	* A skill's walk delay will also delay your can-attack time when the skill
	  connects, since this is the behaviour of Sonic Blows as described by
	  Tharis.
	* Added view_data support to mercenary.*, so that the Homunculus entries
	  are no longer required on the mob_db.
	* Added the status icon to NPC_CHANGEUNDEAD and the Flee/Hit foods.
	* Corrected the check that lets you walk when vending/chatting/etc.
2007/01/22
	* Reverted the battle_calc_return_damage code as the previous one was
	  correct, ninja self-targetted skills CAN be reflected. [Skotlex]
2007/01/21
	* Fixed while statements not "reserving" the curly before parsing the test 
	  expression. [FlavioJS]
2007/01/20
	* Fixed some joker's code trying to dereference a null pointer
	* Fixed the server not reacting properly to atcommands/charcommands when using
	  langtype 10/11 (the |XY codepage indicator wasn't being trimmed) [ultramage]
	* Updated @homshuffle so that the skill tree and current skill points are
	  not messed up.
2007/01/19
	* Fixed the label dup code, it now works correctly with const.txt switch
	  labels.
	* Reverted the dup-label check code since it has a bug that needs to be
	  fixed first (it fails to recognize const.txt values) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a client crash during SQL char selection if you for some reason had
	  more than 9 characters in your account (thanks to Daegaladh) [ultramage]
	  - note that the TXT version already guards against this since long ago
	* Merged Rayce's cleanups of the script engine that account for duplicate
	  labels, non-numeric labels and makes the engine case-insensitive towards
	  keywords like if/case/switch/etc/
	* Added the icons for the Food boosts (need packet version 8 to get them,
	  as these icons will just display Gloria, or crash you, when used on older
	  clients).
2007/01/18
	* Modified the Storm Gust freeze counter code. It now takes into
	  consideration the ID of the skill before increasing the counter, which
	  should effectively yield the closest aproximation to official (even though
	  the counter will reset if you step out of a SG and into another one, we do
	  not know yet what should happen in such a case).
	* Added @homshuffle. It recalculates the homunculus stats, as if the homunc
	  was sent back to level 1, and then releveled. This command is mean to help
	  fix those previously created Homunculus that are much stronger than they
	  should be.
	* Fixed overflow on the mob delay adjustment setting.
	* Fixed characters being unable to trade again if you attempt a trade on
	  someone who is on storage/npc when you accept the trade. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash when a castle from [0..MAX-1] wasn't in the db [ultramage]
2007/01/17
	* Corrected atcommand @homstats so it shows the correct minimum/maximum
	  possible values.
	* Simplified the hom level up function, now decimal stats are no longer
	  stored. This should correct eA's homunculus on average being much stronger
	  than Aegis's.
	* Cleaned up pc_allskillup, @allskills should work correctly now.
2007/01/16
	* Added atcommand @homstats so you can check your homunculus stats and
	  compare them to the minimum/maximum values that you could have at your
	  current level. This command is meant to help figure out if homuncs are
	  indeed getting a faster stat growth than they should have.
	* Fixed the next invoked skill after AbraCadabra not having requirements
	  even when it is a different skill than the one chosen by AbraCadabra.
	* Implemented Intravision as it should be. Thanks to HelloKitty2 for the
	  captured packets.
	* Some cleaning on the mob_ai to enable mobs to run away from their current
	  target when they are rude-attacked by them.
2007/01/15
	* The NPC elemental attacks will display a skill animation again.
	* Mob instant cast skills will use their adelay now.
	* Spirit of Wizard won't work on Ganbantein
	* The pc normalize job function will consider you as novice if you don't
	  have maxed out basic skill.
	* Cleaned up pc_calc_skilltree and related functions so that the id is left
	  as 0 when you can't raise the skill even if you meet the prerequisites.
	  This is to prevent raising quest/soul/marriage skills through packets.
	* Slaves should lock unto their master's target even if they are not
	  attacking yet (eg: in chase mode)
	* Updated the Summon Slave skill to use the slave distance define as valid
	  distance to spawn from master.
	* Fixed Joint Beat's speed penalty.
	* Added a pc_authok check to prevent the case in which somehow another
	  character of the same account manages to log in as well.
	* The pc normalize job function will now recognize you as a novice if you
	  don't have NV_BASIC maxed.
	* Accessories will now by default go into the rigth-side rather than the
	  left-side of the equip window.
	* Added a check in the mob_ai_subhard function to make mobs unlock targets
	  which have their invincible timer set.
	* Probably fixed the registration flood protection code being broken.
	* Joint Break should only re-start the bleeding timer when it currently IS
	  the one that causes bleeding. [Skotlex]
2007/01/12
	* Cleaned up the ip rules/DDoS section of the code. (the allow,deny and 
	  deny,allow cases were switched)
	* Fixed autotrading characters not being able to reconnect. Seams like I 
	  misunderstood how id_db and pc_db are used. [FlavioJS]
2007/01/11
	* Fixed the script engine not parsing strings in multibyte charsets 
	  correctly (should have been done in r9532).
	* Console plugin working when built as Windows native. [FlavioJS]
2007/01/10
	* Combined most of the txt/sql mobdb reading code [ultramage]
	- mob.c is now some 10kB less redundant (now using a common function)
	- automatically filled in some missing parts of the txt part
	  (view_range_rate, chase_range_rate, line counting, etc)
	- also cleaned it up significantly
2007/01/09
	* Changes to script buildin functions: [FlavioJS]
	- functions checking if a player is attached as soon as possible.
	- functions that required a player attached and would crash if none was 
	  there terminate the script now. (others keep the current behaviour to 
	  maintain full backward compatibility)
	- removed the unused flag argument in guildskill.
	- bonus,bonus2,bonus3,bonus4 use the same function now (remains the same 
	  script-wise)
	- added an optional parameter to setcart,setfalcon,setriding so it's 
	  possible to remove the cart/falcon/mount or select a specific cart
	- other cleanups
2007/01/08
	* Hotfix: Freeing of freed pointer when replacing script functions. [Lance]
	* Unimportant cleanups
	* Moved the plugin.def file to the plugins dir and added console.def
	* Found the reason why the console didn't want to run on windows
	  (Microsoft uses !0 and unix uses 0 in pipe_create)
	* Commented out a login_log call (sql doesn't implement that function!)
	* Fixed an old debug message displaying %d instead of a number
	* Silenced the plugin export messages during startup [ultramage]
	* Added a precompiler error when the shutdown defines are not found.
	* Added parse_console to the plugin API.
	* Added plugin for parsing the console. (working with cygwin)
	* Copied the parse_console code form login txt to login sql and char.
	* Added propper plugin version compatibility tests.
	* Better output when a plugin fails to load. [FlavioJS]
2007/01/07
	* Fixed the sleep timers not being removed when the an npc was being 
	  unloaded and when reloading scripts. [FlavioJS]
	* Updated the documentation to match the agitcheck() behavior
	* Undid the memset->malloc_set replacement
	  (let's be compatible and leave such optimizations to system devs, ok?)
	* Small reformatting of conf-tmpl
	* Renamed atcommand_sub to is_atcommand_sub (charcommand too)
	* Re-added the duplicit nj/gs name messages in msg_athena [ultramage]
	  (the code was using those and they look better in that position)
2007/01/06
	* Now winsock 2 is required.
	* Cleaned up do_close and socket_init a bit.
	* Fixed the weight icon dissapearing and reappearing when attacking.
	  (introduced by me at r9600, fix based on ultramage's code) [FlavioJS]
2007/01/05
	* Also discarded some veeery old utils code that has got equivalents
	  in the std libs (and therefore is silently causing a nasty collision).
	* Major reconfiguration of the VS8 project files. [ultramage]
	- Removed the migration binding to a VS71 template.
	- Disabled the setting that defines char -> unsigned char (non-conformant).
	- Switched all projects to use the common C runtime library DLL
	  instead of linking the static version to each exe.
	- Enabled edit&continue on the TXT version (SQL already had it).
	- Reconfigured the linker to use only the really required dependencies.
	- Enabled full optimization and whole program optimization,
	  with additional speed-improving settings for the release build.
	- Set the compiler/linker to produce detailed debug information even for release builds
	  (no performance penalty because the debug info is stored in a separate .pdb file!).
	- I tested all 4 build combinations and it works for me, and it should work for you.
	- There is still one very useful thing missing - setting the working dir to '..'.
	  I don't know how to do that, tho' since VS stores it in a separate user file.
2007/01/04
	* Fixed old @go bug (it ignored einbech) [Lupus]
	* Added Au{R}oN's updated version of the effect list.
	* Completed adding of the new cities to @go.
	  > that function is ugly and needs a complete rewrite, asap.
	* Updated thor volcano warps.
	* Updated /doc from jAthena. [ultramage]

2007/01/03
	* Added Rachel and Veins to the list of @go destinations.
	* Added a first approximation of warps for the new maps (by $ephiroth).
	* Now the server will by default perform symmetric adding of friends. [ultramage]
	  > TODO - symmetric deletion (http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=130749)
	* Fixed TURBO FIFO defines.
	* Moved refusal of a known packet versions to clif_parse_WantToConnection
	  and made it check for non-player object with that id.
	* JK_JOINTBEAT as described in:
	  http://www.ragnainfo.net/wiki/index.php/Vital_Strike
	  Although not clear, it's being assumed that the 2x damage is only for the
	  break neck ailment. [FlavioJS]
	* Modified the useless error message in atcommand_effect.
	* Silenced the debug message in socket.c that's been freaking people out.
	* Added support for text/comments at the end of monster spawn lines (<tab> required)
	* Added the official behavior of monsters regaining full hp when they morph.
	  > info at http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=130103
	* Fixed pc_calc_skilltree ignoring prerequisites / joblvl requirements for soullinked skills.
	  > TODOs at http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=130788
	* Re-applied change r9593 that got accidentally reverted by r9595. [ultramage]

2007/01/02
	* Fixed SC_JOINTBEAT not doing crit damage for the Neck Break ailment.
	* Gospel sends the buff message to the affected player. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/31
	* Made HSCR bypass both Guard and Shield Reflect using the dirty way [DracoRPG]
	  > cleaner way would need to rethink the whole skill's implementation
	* Added more info when npc_scriptcont tries to continue a different script.
	* Refer to http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=130285
	- Renamed pc_checkweighticon to pc_updateweightstatus and cleaned it.
	- Updated pc_is50overweight to use battle_config.natural_heal_weight_rate.
	- Added 90% weight check when attacking.
	* Updated getitem and guardian entries in script_commands.txt.
	* Fixed getitem trying to get <character ID> from the wrong argument.
	* Now getitem can be run on scripts without a player attached if 
	  <character ID> is specified.
	* Now the two last arguments of guardian are optional and independant of 
	  each other ("<event label>" and <guardian index>). This way the previous 
	  implementation and script_commands definition are still valid code.
	* Now buildin function names and argument definitions are checked for 
	  validity before adding the function to the script engine.
	  Argument definitions follow the pattern: (v|s|i|l)*\?*\*? [FlavioJS]
2006/12/30
	* Reverted the packet structure changes to mmo_char_send006b in r9588 (was 
	  using the wrong exe for the final tests) except for the bug that I was 
	  originally fixing. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/29
	* Skill use is now cancelled when you use it while cloaking, and the
	  uncloaking process warps you. [Skotlex]
2006/12/28
	* Reapplied Skotlex's socket.c changes from r9587 and r9582. :S
	* Part 3 of TheUltraMage's socket cleanup.
	* Fixed the packet structure in mmo_char_send006b for PACKETVER 8.
	* Removed search_str from add_str (add_str already searches for the 
	  string).
	* Native script words like do,while,for,... are case insensitive now.
	* Changed SCRIPT_HASH_SIZE to 1021 (prime hash sizes give better 
	  distributions).
	* Added alternative hash implementations to the script engine (to try out 
	  later). [FlavioJS]
	* Added a func_parse invocation when an invalid socket is found, so that
	  the underlying code (char/map/login) can handle it and free any related
	  resources.
	* Added some skill effect packets so it displays a generic effect for
	  unknown targetted skills.
	* Some cleaning in do_sendrecv, added error messages when handling an
	  incorrect socket. [Skotlex]
2006/12/27
	* Fixed Super Novice 99%+ invincibility triggering when
	  the character dies in a GvG area. [blackhole89]
	* Updated SQL Files [Toms]
	* Fixed a bug which makes the group heal bonus be applied as many times as
	  the item is in that group.
	* Applied Rayce's suggestion to improve the script hash size usage. eA now
	  uses a hash of 1024.
	* Full Buster's auto-blind chance is now reducable by stats/items.
2006/12/2
	* Updated Charge Attack's damage equation as per the only source I've seen
	  of it so far.
	* Now Guardians/Emperium can't hit /be hit if their current map isn't a
	  gvg_castle or woe is off. This enables "localized" WoE by removing/setting
	  the mapflag gvg_castle on the castles where you want WoE to take effect
	  (note that even though normal players can't be hit on non gvg_castle maps,
	  normal mobs can still be killed in such maps, you'd still need to modify
	  the WoE scripts to use this kind of feature)
	* TK_MISSION will now pick any mob from the DB as long as it is not a boss
	  type and it gives base exp.
	* Fixed the double-stone issue when hitting a petrified character.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/12/25
	* Fixed buildin_getscrate, thanks Trancid.
	* Applied part 1 of TheUltraMage's socket cleanup.
	  "Basically what I did was perform simple one-liner substitutions for 
	   ugly repetitive blocks of code. The most apparent are the send/recv 
	   code and the other basic socket calls."
	* flush_fifo is non-blocking now. I guess best effort is good enough...
	* Copied header files from vcproj-7.1 files to vcproj-8 files.
	* Applied the rest of Rayce's suggestions and fixes
	  (http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=129185)
	* warn_cmd_no_comma, warn_func_no_comma, warn_cmd_mismatch_paramnum are 
	  now warn_func_mismatch_paramnum and it only prevents showing the error,
	  as it was probably intended in the first place. (correct me if i'm wrong)
	* Merged the parsing of function calls in the script engine, removing the 
	  parse_cmd hackery, and made "heal (.@val+rand(0xff))&0xff,0;" valid 
	  again. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/24
	* Small fix for changeset 9539 (support for PACKETVER above 7) [KarLaeda]
2006/12/23
	* Fallback for parenthesis argument lists in the script engine. 
	  "func (exp) , ..." is valid again.
	* Moved "#include <limits.h>" to cbasetypes.h to ensure it's included 
	  before checking if UINT_MAX has been defined.
	* Minor changes in pc_readdb related to max_level being unsigned.
	[FlavioJS]
2006/12/22
	* Simplified function agitcheck so it isn't crash prone. Now it takes no
	  arguments, and will return whether WoE is on or not.
	* Now when you specify a max level beyond what the exp table has, the last
	  entry of the exp table will be duplicated to fill in the remaining levels.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Change strncpy to memcpy when parsing switches in the script engine 
	  since it's guaranteed to be a word of that size (skip_word).
	* Made scriptlabel_db duplicate the key. When str_buf is reallocated, the 
	  keys in scriptlabel_db could become invalid, causing a crash in 
	  npc_convertlabel_db.
	* Now npc_convertlabel_db clears scriptlabel_db after using it.
	* parse_script has an extra parameter options. At the moment it only 
	  indicates if scriptlabel_db should be used or not.
	* Fixed "UINT_MAX undeclared" on systems that don't declare it in limits.h
	  [FlavioJS]
2006/12/21
	* Applied Rayce's suggestions and fixes to the script engine
	  (http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=129185)
	* Some cleaning to the character deletion code.
	* Changed a certain snprintf to strncpy, which should fix the problems with
	  parsing switches in the script engine.
	* Added back cropping the attack delay to attack motion for those weird mobs
	  that have a aDelay less than their aMotion time. [Skotlex]
	* Added a 1-node cache to db. Removed party_cache and guild_cache since 
	  now the database has a cache.
	* Fixed "warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type"
	  by restricting script words to ASCII characters only.
	* Moved md5calc to common. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/20
	* Fixed ISSPACE and ISALPHA casting their returned value to a char, which
	  can really mess up the scripting engine when the returned value is true,
	  yet casted to false.
	* Moved the strip unequip code to before deleting the timer, this fixes
	  trying to "re-strip" someone causing the skill to fail and on top of that
	  terminate their current strip effect.
	* Reading of TK Mission variables will now happen if you are a TK-class
	  character regardless of whether you know TK_MISSION or not. Should fix
	  being able to reset skills to reset your Mission data.
	* Added an ugly work around to the issue of skills with additional effect
	  causing opt1 status when they have just terminated them (in short, you
	  shouldn't be able to hit someone with, say, sleep, and then have the same
	  skill cause them stun, since both are opt1 values). [Skotlex]
	* Now root script functions calls can have parenthesis (will take any 
	  parenthesis after the function as the start of the argument list).
	- This means "func (exp),exp;" isn't valid anymore.
	* Replaced our fix for "mes ();" crashing by jA's version.
	* Merged the fix for & having the same precedence as << and >> from jA.
	* Merged the C_OP3 operator from jA: test ? if_true : if_false
	* Changed the script source from unsigned char* to const char*.
	* Updated plugins Makefile. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/19
	* Reverted the mob ThinkTime update, that field is again aDelay as it
	  apparently should be. [Skotlex]
	* Cleanups or minor changes.
	* Now addtick_timer invokes settick_timer, so keep an eye for whatever 
	  timer issues it's supposed to have.
	* Removed the flush_fifo from clif_parse_TickSend until the socket 
	  problems are fixed. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/18
	* Updated POS2 macros. The 6th byte is subx0 and suby0. [FlavioJS]
	* Added hom_setting to specify which homunculus 'quirks' are in effect. The
	  default activates all of them, if you set them to 0 then homuncs will not
	  be treated in any special matter, pretty much like standard mobs. if I
	  missed any 'quirky' homunc behaviour from it, report it so it can be added
	  to the list.
	* Made flooritem_lifetime a int so you can specify much longer life times
	  (the default of 60k was already very close to the max of 65k)
	* Removed monster_ai 0x80 since it's now handled by hom_setting.
	* When walking into a Guild Dungeon your pvp_points will be set to 5 so you
	  have to die twice before being warped out.
	* If jobchanging while disguised, the disguise will be removed, since it
	  can't be kept and still calculate correctly the new job class to use.
	* Fuuma shurikens are now unbreakable code-wise (like all maces, books,
	  etc)
	* Applied Meruru's patch to increase speed of easy path seeks. [Skotlex]
	* Cosmetic changes to db.
	* Fixed the unused MAPINDEX_AUTOADD section in mapindex.c (mapindex.h 
	  wasn't being included) [FlavioJS]
2006/12/16
	* Moved packet_len_table values to packet_db[SERVER].
	* When an invalid packet_ver is found, all it's entries are discarted 
	  intead of just stopping the parsing.
	* Increased MAX_PACKET_DB to 0x300 and added a warning for when packet ids 
	  greater than MAX_PACKET_DB are found. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/15
	* There will be now warnings printed when a shop sells an item which's buy
	  price is 20z, since those usually are "rare" items with no buyying price
	  set. Note that this reports one fake, and that is the selling of a certain
	  shuriken that indeed costs 20z.
	* Most likely fixed client crash when xmas/wedding status runs out.
2006/12/14
	* Removed "mobs being enemies of each other all the time" because, even
	  though mobs can hit each other as they should, they will refuse to use
	  support skills on enemies, which breaks several of their skills. Mobs can't
	  both help and attack someone tagged as enemy!
	  (I guess eA is just too smart to emulate Aegis's sloppy coding)
	* Cleaned up the strip code (GS_DISARM, rogue skills).
	* Cleaned some the MD_DETECTOR code.
2006/12/13
	* Additional damage bonuses (True Sight, EDP, Assassin Link, Crusader Link,
	  Card skill damage bonuses) are now applied independently of each other,
	  which lets them stack. [Skotlex]
	* Modified flush_fifo so the code do what is written in the comment [Toms]
	* Modified flush_fifo so you can decide whether to block the current thread
	  or not until the data is sent. The server-tick reply no longer blocks the
	  current thread.
	* Fixed mobs being unable to attack anything... 
2006/12/12
	* Reverted the knockback update since it isn't working right with all
	  skills.
	* Mobs now by default are "everyone's" enemy, so mobs are able to hit each another. 
	* Moved "unsetting" the angry mode from the mob_ai to the mob_damage
	  function, where it'll work regardless of who hits the mob.
	* Modifed a bit the clif_change_look function, it should fix crashes with
	  the Xmas sprite when changing maps.
	* Fixed skills displaying a 32k damage when used while disguised. [Skotlex]
	* Minor changes to ers.
	* Removed unused/hardly used cbasetypes typedefs.
	* Updated txt-converter's makefile to include utils.o [FlavioJS]
	* Updated npc_event_dequeue to free up your current npc information, and
	  not just the npc_id.
	* Modified the skill damage packet and the knockback packets to mimic aegis
	  sent packets for such skills.
	* Removed CART_MASK as OPTION_CART can take care of that.
	* Moved the OPTION_MASK define to status.h
	* Reverted the knockback implementation to use clif_slide instead of
	  clif_fixpos [Skotlex]
2006/12/11
	* Added various missing checks when parsing several guild actions.
	* made @hominfo display the six basic stats.
	* Simplified the MD_DETECTOR checks, since now all insects/demons have it
	  set, and it's no longer needed to check for the race. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Spirit of Sin and Enchant Deadly Poison now stack.
	* Fixed skill damage card bonuses not working on magic skills.
	* Moved the setting of sd->npc_id = 0 in npc_dequeue to the beginning,
	  since this function is called when a script is cancelled
	* Made homunc's speed be recalculated when you respawn it from rest state.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @revive not reviving the good char [Toms]
2006/12/10
	* Added more helpfull messages when packet_ver=-1.
	* Joined normal and MINICORE's main function.
	* Put malloc_init() first and malloc_final() last as it's needed for Show* 
	  in display_title(). [FlavioJS]
2006/12/09
	* Reversed revision #9415 (messages with server_tick field being sent as 
	  soon as possible) since it didn't fix the client synchronization issue.
	* clif_parse_TickSend is sent immediately so the client gets accurate
	  "pings". [FlavioJS]
2006/12/08
	* Now you can request a trade regardless of the state of the target trader.
	  [Skotlex]
	* The trade will now fail when you accept it and either character is
	  speaking with an npc, vending or has the storage open. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when looters became full. [Skotlex]
	* Autospell delay time is now the skill's full delay.  [Skotlex]
2006/12/07
	* Fixed ladmin's linux compilation and moved some platform specific 
	  defines to cbasetypes.h [FlavioJS]
	* Cleaned up implementation of NPC_EMOTION/NPC_EMOTION_ON. Now val0 is the
	  emotion, val1 sets the mode, val2 adds to the mode, val3 removes from the
	  mode. val4 asks to remove the previous mode change, otherwise it will stack
	  with the changes from the previous skill call. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob skill reading code so it accepts hexadecimals in the
	  'val' fields. Also, it will optimize the NPC values so that when you set a
	  mob's mode to their db mode, it will just remove the previous mode.
	  [Skotlex]
	* NPC_EMOTION_ON will now automatically move it's new mode to val2 since it
	  should add a mode, and if this mode doesn't has the aggressive bit, it will
	  remove it. See this "ancient" hypothesis on how NPC_EMOTION_ON should work
	  for the details: [Skotlex]
		http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=63606
	* Fixed npc commands atcommand & charcommand not working with a custom
	  command_symbol [Toms]
2006/12/06
	* Changed the order of view-change packets for SC xmas/wedding, should fix
	  crashing if you change into xmas suit while in fighting stance. [Skotlex]
	* Renamed the mob mode Cast-Sensor Melee to Cast-Sensor idle since these
	  mobs really should only be cast-sensing when they are not after another
	  target. [Skotlex]
	* Added a Aegis Mob Type -> eA Mode table conversion to the mob modes doc.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files [Playtester]
	* Gave a minimum think time to the dummy mob and to clones. [Skotlex]
	* Moved setting a mob's chase/attack states from the mob_ai to unit_attack
	  and unit_walktobl for better state-handling precision. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned the change-target/cast-sensor code to account for the new mob
	  modes. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the doc explaining mob modes. [Skotlex]
	* When GM skill unconditional is set, the arrow state of the skill will be
	  calculated, this fixes all skills getting stuck on arrow-type after you
	  attack normally. [Skotlex]
	* Alchemist famous potions get their 50% bonus on top of the natural
	  bonuses as a 1.5x type of bonus. In other words, now alchemist potions
	  will really heal 50% more than when you use the non-famous potion
	  version.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Messages with server_tick field are sent as soon as possible now.
	  This might fix client synchronization issues.
	* Added StringBuf_Vprintf to utils.c and changed the showmsg.c buffer.
	  Now it uses a static buffer and a StringBuf when needed (a debug message 
	  indicating the static buffer needs to be increased is shown). [FlavioJS]
2006/12/05
	* The can log value now is "reset" when you die allowing you to
	  respawn/quit instantly after death. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed sc data load failing when using charsave_method: 1 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the interserver link reserve size being 8 times instead of 1/8th
	  the default size. Changed it to be 1/4th as well. [Skotlex]
	* Found the position of emblem_id in packet 1b6.
	* Moved START_ACCOUNT_NUM and END_ACCOUNT_NUM from login.h to mmo.h and 
	  changed clif_guess_PacketVer to use that.
	* Made the script engine big-endian compatible.
	* Commented out the remnants of ladmin packet parsing in map-server.
	* Added a warning when a player has an invalid packet version (shouldn't 
	  happen). [FlavioJS]
2006/12/04
	* Fixed HVAN_INSTRUCT int bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Renamed mob_db's "adelay" column to ThinkTime and made the mob.c code use
	  it instead of MIN_MOBTHINKTIME. The adelay of mobs will also be equal to
	  their thinktime unless their thinktime is less than their attack motion.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added a static +100 Hp to ninjas and gunslingers since it's required for
	  the best approximated hp growth algorythm. [Skotlex]
	* Knockback will again use the fixpos packet instead of the slide packet
	  (slide was introduced with high jump) since Aegis captures say that packet
	  is still used for knockbacks. [Skotlex]
	* Repairing items via scripts no longer displays "item has been repaired"
	  [Skotlex]
	* Status Recovery again makes mobs unlock their current target. [Skotlex]
	* Moved requesting party/guilds from the char-server from pc_authok to
	  pc_reg_received, since map_nick2sd and map_getallsd won't work until the
	  characters are authentified. Also removed the guild master setting from
	  clif_parse_LoadEndAck to pc_reg_received since guild master setting will
	  work there. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed homun hunger timer being started on login even when hom is
	  vaporized/dead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mvp exp attacker bonus applying incorrectly. [Skotlex]
	* Removed duplicate msg_athena.conf entries 619 and 620 for
	  Ninja/Gunslinger.[Skotlex]
	* Fixed the txt->sql converter not escaping character names before saving
	  them. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a pet's level not resetting to their db level when you enable pet
	  leveling and later on decide to turn it off. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed restricted equipment not updating your view info after they are
	  unequipped. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a bunch of extra text/checks when ignoring characters (/ex) when
	  Aegis does none of these checks. /inall now wipes your ignore list (it does
	  this on Aegis, too). [Skotlex]
2006/12/03
	* If somehow a player logs out and it's saved with 0 hp, on login his state
	  will be set to dead as well so he can respawn (otherwise that leads to a
	  stuck char) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed even share exp flutuating as described in:
	  http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=126139
	  thanks to TheUltraMague for the fix.
	* Made ers double frees report as missing entries on destruction.
	* Only one swap function (in cbasetypes.h) is used. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/02
	* Added buildin_checkvending and buildin_checkchatting. [Lance]
	* Enabled atcommand parsing for clients with Korean langtype and version. [Lance]
	* Added missing min/max definitions to cbasetypes.h, needed for the @send change.
	* Replaced @send with the version I use for testing packets.
	  Can display the packet length. Supports dynamic packets, quoted strings 
	  with escaped characters and fixed/variable length, and normal/hex 
	  byte/word/long data types. The number of fields is not limited, but it 
	  automatically stops parsing when the packet is full. [FlavioJS]
2006/12/01
	* Fixed passive mobs becoming increasingly unlikely to retaliate to attacks
	  after they got inflicted by a disabling status change. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the "is_boss" define to check for mode MD_BOSS instead of giving
	  mvp exp. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Fixed txt-converter compilation. [Skotlex]
	* STRECOVERYno longer makes a mob unlock it's target like Cure does.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed GS_GROUNDDRIFT consuming ammo when it's time expires (so it was
	  consuming 2 grenades instead of one). Also added a "explosion effect" when
	  their time runs out. [Skotlex]
	* gvg_dungeon mapflag won't set pvp related mapflags anymore, pc_dead will
	  force pvp ranking gain/loss on gvg_dungeon maps now. [Skotlex]
	* Now when coming out of hiding land-effects will trigger on the character.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed land effects not taking effect inmediately on map-load when the
	  invincible timer is disabled. [Skotlex]
2006/11/29
	* Probably fixed the Segmentation Faults we've been having.
	  Description: A player quits and it's session is freed and set to NULL, 
	       but the char server already sent a packet with player information 
	       (registers, storage, ...). If a message is sent in consequence of 
	       updating that info, a segmentation fault happens because 
	       session[sd->fd] is already NULL.
	  Fix: make shure the session of the target player is valid before 
	       processing the rest of the char server's message.
	* Some minor cleanups. [FlavioJS]
	* Fixed the new npc parsing code not accounting for windows-style line
	  terminators, which as a side effect messed up mapflag parsing if the file
	  had windows-style terminators, which coincidentally was the case for the
	  nopvp file, which unfortunately meant that all towns became pvp! [Skotlex]
	* HT_PHANTASMIC no longer knocks back even when it misses. [Skotlex]
	* Earned exp by dead homuns will now be lost (same treatment as earned exp
	  from players that died) [Skotlex]
	* Now gvg_dungeon mapflag will activate the other mapflags which are
	  required: pvp, pvp_nocalcrank and pvp_noparty/pvp_noguild (they are forced
	  to off if gvg_dungeon is on and viceversa) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned the pvp ranking code so that it takes effect even if
	  pvp_nocalcrank is active WHEN the map is a gvg_dungeon one. [Skotlex]
	* Now homuncs and their masters are the only ones who can use support
	  skills on them. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning on the homunc speed calculating code, so that it correctly
	  uses the default walk speed if the player has no speed yet. [Skotlex]
2006/11/28
	* Fixed a typo which made the wedding_ignore_palette setting not work when
	  you log on with them equipped [Skotlex]
	* Applied The Ultra Mage's patch to use strict npc header formatting
	  parsing. Updated the relevant stock scripts/mapflags that didn't conform to
	  the standard. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the blocking of casting supportive skills on homunculus from
	  battle_check_target to status_check_skilluse as bct is not invoked unless
	  the skill is offensive (or party/guild only) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up status_calc_bl_sub_hom, fixed recasting dex/str/vit/int
	  bonuses skills making their atk/def/mdef stack with itself over and over.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Changing setting the Guild Master from pc_authok to clif_parse_LoadEndAck
	  so that it will not fail to set the gmaster flag when the first person of a
	  guild to log on is the guild master. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the way Storm Gust freeze's counter works. Now it checks for the
	  caster of the Storm Gust, if it's the same as the previous hit, the counter
	  is increased, otherwise, the ID is updated and the counter is changed to 1.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed always receiving at least 1 bexp/jexp even when the mob gives no
	  exp at all. [Skotlex]
	* Changed write to send as suggested by TheUltraMage in:
	  http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=105417
	  Hopefully that will take care of the SIGPIPE problem in Debian and cygwin.
	* Server name in core.c skipping '\\' characters.
	* Memory allocation functions using file,line,func from the invoking functions.
	* Other minor malloc changes. [FlavioJS]
2006/11/27
	* Now when a player's "attack once" request fails due to range, the client
	  is told to move to the target to attack it. This sort of fixes the problem
	  of the client SPAMMING the server with attack requests from afar without
	  even approaching the icewall. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the status change field "option" to an int rather than short.
	  This fixes the option values for xmas/sightblaster not getting set, which
	  could explain why some people crash when equipping weapons while in xmas
	  suit. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Homunculus hungry timer not starting on login. [Skotlex]
	* Added logging for standard GM commands (/mm /b /kick etc) [KarLaeda]
	* Some cleanups on the trade_additem function. When specifying a qty of 0,
	  an ack will be returned to the client so it doesn't gets stuck. [Skotlex]
	* Update sql files [Toms]
	* Corrected the skill animation for Absorb Spirits [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the implementation of how Gravity Field blocks the
	  caster from moving. [Skotlex]
	* Mob class-changing will fail if the new class is the same as the previous
	  one. [Skotlex]
2006/11/24
	* Homunc's min matk is now always equal to max matk [Skotlex]
	* Fixed EDP's damage being 100% more than it should (should be 4x, not 5x
	  on normal attacks) [Skotlex]
	* Self Destruction will only hit everyone and not just enemies when used by
	  mobs (non marine spheres) unless the map is a versus map. [Skotlex]
	* Spider Web's duration is now halved on players (before it was halved in
	  pvp maps only) [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed Homunculus not disappearing the second their intimacy hit 0.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed uninitialized variable fd being used in WFIFOHEAD in a few clif
	  functions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the fact that the TURBO code breaks when you attempt to handle more
	  than one connection at a time within the same function. However this broke
	  map-server compilation, therefore, don't use TURBO yet! [Skotlex]
	* While at it, cleaned a few packet implementations in the char/login
	  servers which were not only ugly, but had some really stupid flaws within.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/11/23
	* Completed Reddozen's hanging mapwarp code to support party and old syntax. [Lance]
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Made WFIFOHEAD() check for available buffer size remaining on the
	  connection, and when there's not enough space, it will increase it.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added define TURBO to the Makefile. It enables MouseJstr's socket access
	  optimization which should speed up the code when accessing the write/read
	  buffers repeatedly within a function. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the functions where the RFIFOHEAD/WFIFOHEAD functions were used
	  incorrectly (prevents TURBO enabled compilations from finishing) [Skotlex]
2006/11/22
	* Modified slaves_inherit_speed and slaves_inherit_mode so you get better
	  control of when to copy/remove modes/speed. See the conf changelog for
	  details. [Skotlex]
	* Reenabled usage of mode MD_CHANGETARGET, so mobs with mode 0x200 will be
	  able to switch targets while attacking. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups around usage of session[] in the map server, hoping that it
	  may fix some not very likely crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote a few messy @ commands. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the homunc hungry timer being started when the homun data is
	  received from the char-server and the homunc is NOT 'active'. [Skotlex]
2006/11/21
	* Fixed the Auto-Berserk giving you back defense when it triggers during
	  berserk's HP penalty. [Skotlex]
	* Some small changes in the pet ai to make it more responsive. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the pet looting behaviour (taken from the mob's), pets are much
	  more smarter now when looting from multiple possible items. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pets/homunc trying to be deleted twice when they had 0 intimacy and
	  their master logs out. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for specifying ammo type = 99 in the skill_require_db file,
	  it can be used to specify that any kind of ammo can be used with the skill,
	  but you NEED to have ammo equipped. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected GS_DISARM, it is now a normal attack, which, when it connects,
	  has a chance to do strip weapon at a 3*lv% rate (modified by dex) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed GS_PIERCINGSHOT, it should ignore defense [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Gatling Fever costing SP when trying to turn it off. Also,
	  speed increases bonuses won't take effect while it's active. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the main makefile with a new OPT line. It is commented by default
	  since it only works with GCC 4.X, when unset, it will hide away a huge
	  amount of warnings that have to do with stuff that is not gonna be
	  corrected in eA anyway. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected TripleAction's damage. It should do 150%*3 instead of 100*3%
	  damage. [Skotlex]
	* Updated GS_CRACKER's stun chance using Doddler's info as reference.
	  [Skotlex]
	* GS_FLING won't reduce armor defense when used on players. [Skotlex]
	* Moved ignoreAll to state.ignoreAll so it saves some space. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up clif_parse_Wis to prevent crashes from forged packets
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the implementation of the ignore list so it's more efficient.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/11/20
	* Implemented NPC_DEFENDER. Reduces ranged Physical+Misc damage by 80%
	  [Skotlex]
	* Improved the battle config reader so it accepts hexadecimal values.
	  Updated the monster_ai description to make use of this [Skotlex]
	* Added monster_ai&0x200. When set, mob skill delays are shared. That is,
	  if the mob has several lines with the same skill, when the skill is used,
	  the delay will be set to all of them, not just the one entry used.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected NPC_BARRIER so it grants 100 def/mdef (and not just mdef)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Weapon ATK bonuses will now only apply to watk and NOT watk2 on players
	  (on players watk2 is refine bonus) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected NPC_KEEPING. it should give 90 def, not 100 [Skotlex]
	* You now can't use other skills while a skill-induced "window" is up
	  (teleport, refining, etc). However, be warned that we aren't quite sure how
	  the server will clear this out if you decide to hit cancel on the window,
	  so skill-blockage is likely to happen (temporary solution: whenever you
	  change maps or warp the state is reset server-side). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed itemskill variable being cleared before parsing the skill, this
	  causes auto-casted teleport to fail to skip the skill menu. It is now
	  cleared on castend_pos/id directly. [Skotlex]
	* Skills with state 'move_enable' will now do a "walk path" check between
	  target cell/object and caster instead of a "shoot path" check, this would
	  fix skills like snap or charge from letting you "teleport" across pits.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Raised the amount of skills that can stack on a single cell before the
	  "in-area/out-area" detection code breaks to 24 (from 8) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash in clif_SkillInfoBlock if the passed player already
	  disconnected. [Skotlex]
	* Added limiting drop rate to 100% from item-bonuses that depend on the
	  mob's level so that "@autoloot 100" will catch them. [Skotlex]
2006/11/19
	* Removed security check since source level patch is applied. 
	* Reverted select(), created prompt().
	* Hack protection from packet monkeys in clif_parse_NpcSelectMenu. [Lance]
	* Added 'cancel' button parsing in buildin_select menu system. Now scripts will continue
	  to load if 'cancel' is pressed and 255 will be returned. [Lance]

2006/11/17
	* Corrected use of the party invitation reply packet, thanks to FlavioJS.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed potential hack by modifying packet of whispers. [Lance]
	* Fixed potential crash in IRC processing message with '%' using *printf. [Lance]
	* Fixed memory leaking caused by homun_data not freed when removed. [Lance]
	* Fixed client not validating the chat-kick-request packet, which can cause
	  crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Updated map_quit to handle removing of players who are not even
	  authenticated yet. [Skotlex]
	* New connection requests are now also blocked when there's a player
	  already online but hasn't finished loading yet. [Skotlex]
	* Because of these changes, the friendlist notification when people join
	  has been moved to LoadEndAck from pc_authok [Skotlex]
2006/11/16
	* Updated sql files [Toms]
	* For the sake of avoiding confusion, all script events are named with prefix 'On'
	  from now on. [Lance]
	* Edited atcommand and charcommand syntax. Now it doesn't need the useless
	  character name and ":". [Lance]
	* Shadow Jump and Kirikage won't "move" you if you use them in GvG grounds.
	  Fixed Kirikage so it first warps you, and then you unhide. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Zeny Nage so the Zeny spent on the attack is always the exact
	  same value as the damage you are dealing. Also corrected it so it does half
	  damage when used on players. [Skotlex]
	* Overlapping song/dances will now cause dissonance/ugly-dance level 1
	  instead of retaining the level of their song/dance. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed wrong check in @petrename, thanks to The Ultra Mage.[Skotlex]
2006/11/14
	* Early Christmas present. 3 new "features" which were very easy to code,
	  and should help scripters tremendously. Eapp is quite a way from being
	  ready, so these can't hurt:
	* Implemented Karma: It turns out that when someone has karma, the client
	  believes this character is "evil", and will give you a cursor sword on top
	  of them automatically. So now the code will let characters with karma to
	  fight each other. This enables duels and other types of restricted pvp
	  where only the characters with karma can hit each others, and the rest of
	  players with neutral karma cannot be affected. Note that Karma cannot be
	  negative, and it can have any value between 0 and 256 (any non-zero value
	  makes them appear evil on the client). For now, characters with karma can
	  hit each other regardless of karma value, but perhaps it may be better to
	  let them to hit each other ONLY if they have the same karma (the whole
	  duel implementation COULD be cleaned up using Karma instead!)
	* Added mapflags partylock and guildlock, which lock the state of the
	  parties/guilds on said maps:
	  partylock: blocks user party requests to create/invite/leave/kick
	  guildlock: blocks user guild requests to create/invite/leave/expel/
	     make alliance/make opposition/delete alliance/delete opposition/
		  break guild
2006/11/13
	* Fixed a bug where the char-txt server was incorrectly saving memos,
	  causing character data to be lost on restart. [Skotlex]
	* HP Conversion will fail when used at max SP. It should not display any
	  errors to the client. [Skotlex]
	* Modified yet again the login procedure to enable character variables to
	  work on item scripts. It SHOULD work crashless now. Please report any
	  problems it may cause.
	* Volcano/Deluge/Violent Gale are now interchangeable, in the sense that
	  as long as one of these is out, casting any of the three will not consume
	  gems, and will use the remaining time of the previous one. In turn, Land
	  Protector will now always consume gems on every cast. [Skotlex]
	* Small cleanup in the Land protector code which may fix it not blocking
	  AoE skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the interpretation of "head_dir". Removed setting head_dir to match
	  character direction in the whole code. Now it is only reset to 0 (look
	  forward) when unit_setpos is invoked, or when a character begins walking.
	  Thanks to FlavioJS for figuring out how the client parses the head
	  direction. [Skotlex]
	* Moved status_calc_pc back to pc_authok. [Lance]
2006/11/11
	* Fixed debug message in login_sql [KarLaeda]
2006/11/10
	* Deluge/Violent Gale/Volcano tiles will now fail to be placed on cells
	  that are already ocuppied by anything else. [Skotlex]
	* status_is_immune will now return 0 or the amount of immunity of the
	  target. In which cases it returns 100 for WoH and the GTB bonus when they
	  have passed the gtb_sc_immunity setting. This enables targetted spells to
	  not "fail silently" unless GTB's magic reduction is 100. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Homunculus being spawned as soon as they arrive from the
	  char-server even if the Master has not spawned on the map yet. [Skotlex]
	* AL_TELEPORT now fails when used on top of Land Protector. [Skotlex]
	* Some minor cleanings in pc_setpos, it may (or not) help fix that
	  homunc-caused "map_addblock" error message. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected fog of wall, so that the deleted/doubled-duration effects are
	  calculated on a cell-by-cell basis. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Land Protector: It will now delete/block effects of ALL ground
	  skills EXCEPT: Song/Dances/Traps (encores are still blocked). Land skills
	  blocked/deleted by LP also can't be casted on top of an existing LP. The
	  code uses the inf2 value of the skill to determine if it is a
	  song/dance/trap. [Skotlex]
	* Ganbantein, mimicking LP, will now also remove ensembles. [Skotlex]
	* Fog of Wall will fail when casted on top of a Volcano/Violent Gale
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied FlavioJS's fix to the npc whisper system. [Skotlex]
2006/11/09
	* Fixed status-change loading not working. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed permanent mob-spawn script-events not working. [Skotlex]
	* AL_CURE won't confuse undead players. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the Fog of Wall check so that it lasts 2x when it is placed on
	  TOP of a suiton/deluge, not when the caster is on top of them. [Skotlex]
	* Updated status_check_skilluse so that when the caster has a disabling
	  status change (stun/petrify/etc) it will block the skill in all cases
	  EXCEPT on cast-end when the skill is ground-targetted. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Health Conversion skill formula bug. [Lupus]
2006/11/08
	* Fixed Desperado's hit-rate, now it behaves as it should. [Skotlex]
	* The GVG map-packet will now also be sent for guild dungeon maps.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added clif_gospel_info which displays info about the buffs you are
	  receiving. Thanks to Rayce for the packet information. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Spider Web not ending when hit by a fireelemental attack. [Skotlex]
	* Cast-time reductions from status changes will not be executed until right
	  before casting, to prevent status changes from ending when attempting to
	  cast and the attempt fails (invalid cells, not enough sp, wrong target,
	  etc, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent Wand of Hermod from seeking for a partner to
	  encore, since the partner is supposed to be the warp. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the mob spawn reading code so that the event-name can be up to
	  50 characters long (which is the actual event length) and so that it can
	  read spaces within them, it will also strip the leading/trailing quotes if
	  you use them so that the event is actually found on mob-death (so you can
	  do stuff like "My NPC::OnDead" as a valid event). [Skotlex]
	* Moved the homunc inherit speed from the master from status_calc_pc to
	  LoadEndAck, since the hom's speed matches that of the master each time the
	  master changes maps. [Skotlex]
2006/11/07
	* Applied FlavioJs's patch which enables colored console output for Windows
	  systems. It also includes a config setting called
	  "stdout_with_ansisequence" with which you can turn off the color codes (in
	  case you are logging all output) [Skotlex]
	* Added error reporting when the max number of ground unit cells has been
	  reached (this may be the reason why sometimes it fails to recognize when
	  you step out of a song/dance/encore) [Skotlex]
	* Added passing the Endure effect to other devoted people. Note that the
	  "hit count" is individual for each character, and only when it ends on the
	  Crusader himself will that force it to end on everyone else. It also will
	  not transfer on gvg grounds, but it does transfer in pvp. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Reflect-Shield triggering Auto-Guard instead on devoted chars.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to prevent casting ground skills on a target and vice-versa
	  when said skill use packets are received. It really shouldn't be
	  exploitable, but doing that certainly makes the server print a lot of
	  "unknown skill used!" messages. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed map_foreachiddb and map_foreachpc so they don't encapsulate the
	  variable arguments into  a double va_arg list. Thanks to the Ultra Mage for
	  the tip. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the clif_hate/mob_info functions with the correct fields/usage
	  as explained by Rayce. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented clif_feel_hate_reset packet to properly display the Angel of
	  the Sun/Moon/Stars, thanks again to Rayce for the relevant information.
	  [Skotlex]
	* LP will again block all land-stuff from being placed down on top of it
	  for the exception of Song/Dance/Encores. [Skotlex]
2006/11/06
	* Reapplied 'fix equipment scripts which are based on character variables not
	  working.' [Lance]
	* Multiple Gunslinger skill corrections, refer to
	  http://ro.doddlercon.com/guides/gunslinger.html for information source:
	  [Skotlex]
	- Corrected Ground Drift. Splash range of 3x3, stackable and placeable
	  underneath others, cast time is 2 secs. It's considered ranged, and it's
	  bonus damage increase is defense ignoring, always neutral.
	- Corrected Bull's Eye implementation, it should deal normal damage against
	  non brute/demi-human targets.
	- GS_DUST is now considered a short-range attack.
	- Implemented Desperado's hit rate based on distance to caster as it's
	  believed to behave.
	- GS_TRACKING's range is no longer affected by Snake Eye.
	- GS_FLING's defense reduction is now 5*lv%
	* Suiton's Speed/Agi penalty will affect everyone when used in versus maps.
	* Corrected Kaupe so it doesn't ends on the first part of Soul Destroyer.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied some cleaning to the way Tatami Gaeshi knocks back. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the way mobskill_use checks for the correct event. It should
	  fix unlimited mob-skill-casting issues. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the return code entry when logging GM reload-GM requests
	  (login-sql),it'll just be stored as zero. [Skotlex]
	* Added a fix on socket.c to not pick INADDR_ANY when choosing our own IP.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied the correction on maprespawnguildid so that it parses ALL players
	  and not just those on a map. [Skotlex]
	* TK_JUMPKICK now dispels normal aspd/speed potions (not berserk pitched
	  ones) and Preserve will be unable to block this. [Skotlex]
	* Soul Linkers are now inmune to SA_DISPEL [Skotlex]
	* You can now place everything (except magic skills) on top of LPs.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Ganbantein to not touch song/dance/ensembles. [Skotlex]
	* Status_calc_pc will refuse to execute if the player is still tagged as a
	  "new connection" and the invocation is not meant to be the first one.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Swapped the order of checks in status_isimmune so that Wand of Hermod
	  skill blocking takes precedence over GTB's [Skotlex]
	* Client packets will all be ignored while a player is not on a map until
	  the LoadEndAck packet is received. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted changes, moved status_calc_pc(sd,1) back to pc_authok
	  since it causes problems. [Lance]
	* Temperory fixed stability issue caused by initial status_calc_pc
	  being placed AFTER another status_calc_pc. [Lance]
2006/11/05
	* Updated sql files [Toms]
	* Updated perl files acording to rev 9135 [Toms]
2006/11/04
	* Readded duel code in map_quit. Why it has been removed!? [LuzZza]
	* Converted itemdb tables to use smallint. Credits to ALZ. [Lance]
2006/11/01
	* Reverted LK_Berserk HP requirement, as everything, including kRO X.2 and
	  pRO X.3, points that way. [Vicious]
2006/10/31
	* Fixed song/dance/encore cells not being placed down when casted on top of
	  a land Protector. [Skotlex]
	* Update homunc's speed when master's speed changes, should avoid homunc's
	  speed = 0 on login (homunc's stats are calculated before master's stats) [Toms]
	* When Kaizel (or super novice rebirth skill) triggers, you get debuffed
	  now. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the player_cloak_check_type and monster_cloak_check_type
	  settings. 1 makes it check for walls, 2 makes cloaking NOT end on normal
	  attacks, and 4 makes cloaking NOT end when using skills. The default
	  setting for players is still 1, but for mobs the default has been changed
	  to 4. [Skotlex]
	* Non-players can now use all skills while hidden. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to prevent adding negative damage to the total accumulated
	  damage in mob_damage. It could fix some exploits, even though mob_damage
	  should never be invoked with negative damage anyway. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented the property where the first attacker get's double exp-share
	  than the others. Due to the way exp calculation is done, this bonus will
	  not apply when you use exp_calc_type 1 (damage/max_hp) instead of the
	  default (damage/total-damage). For now this bonus is done after calculating
	  who is the MVP character instead of before. [Skotlex]
2006/10/30
	* Fixed a little bug in event enqueue code [Toms]
	* Updated the code so mobs can use ChainAction as a targetted skill.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added GroundDrift effects for Wind (Stun) and Fire (knockback). The
	  knockback value is unknown, so 3 is used for now. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some more the steal code, now you can't steal the last slot
	  regardless of skill level used. [Skotlex]
	* Added consideration of Chain Action when cloning GunSlingers. [Skotlex]
	* Modified battle_calc_return_damage to take the skill id as well, now
	  magic damage return will not work on skills tagged as ground or self
	  targetted. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Gank not working at all with the default max steal tries setting.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Soul Drain won't work with skills tagged as self-targetted. [Skotlex]
	* Improved the Suiton code so that the walk/agi penalty only applies to
	  enemies of whoever casted the skill. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the initial status_calc_pc call to when you finish loading the map,
	  should fix equipment scripts which are based on character variables not
	  working. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed getcharid according to samples and docs. [Lupus]
		Thanks to joshuaali for pointing it out. eAPP has no such bug
2006/10/27
	* Fixed mob-skill event "skillused" not triggering at all. [Skotlex]
	* Summoned mobs will only be removed from a map if their master is also
	  removed (dynamic mobs) [Skotlex]
2006/10/26
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
	* Experimental tweak to npc_parse_function - Overwrite existing functions. [Lance]
2006/10/25
	* Cleaned up some more the event dequeue code, it will no longer clear out
	  the npc_id if there's no events waiting to be executed (why does it clears
	  the npc_id anyway?) [Skotlex]
	* Because of possible conflicts with this change and the on-login script,
	  now the on-login script is executed when the player has finished loading
	  into their start-up map rather than as soon as receiving the registry
	  variables from the char-server. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of the pc_eventtimer and pc enqueue code, it should fix
	  some memory leaks when the event counter does not matches with the actual
	  number of queued timers during logout. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "skill_sp_override_grffile: yes" causing crashes when parsing
	  Homuncuus/Guild skills. [Skotlex]
	* Made the exp bonus settings be adjustable: [Skotlex]
	- exp_bonus_attacker: Indicates how much additional exp a mob gives per
	  additional attacker (eg: 10 -> +10%*attacker)
	- exp_bonus_max_attacker: Indicates at which number of attackers the bonus
	  is capped (eg: 5 -> 5 attackers, so a mob yield the same exp whether 5 or
	  10 people attack it)
	- Changed the way the party_even_share_bonus setting works. It now uses a
	  simple linear bonus increase (eg: 10 -> +10%*party member)
	- The defaults are as explained by Tharis: +25%/attacker, capped at 12
	  attackers, no party bonus. The first two can be found in exp.conf, the last
	  one was left in party.conf
	* MG_STONECURSE and NPC_PETRIFYATTACK now use time1 to specify the
	  "petrifying time". This value has been set to 5 seconds. [Skotlex]
	* Now when SC_STONE is triggered from status-change cards, it's petrifying
	  duration will be passed as 0, causing the minimum (1 sec) to be used.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Got rid of clones in src: old Novice Grounds map -> new_zone0? [Lupus]
2006/10/24
	* Removed again your mdef reducing "petrifying" time as apparently it can't
	  be reduced by mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the "show_steal_in_party" setting so it only takes effect when
	  the item was successfully stolen (there was no point in telling you the
	  item couldn't be stolen due to being overweight) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the pc_steal_item implementation (again). It now uses a more
	  random, simple approach in each steal attempt. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the way the skill_steal_max_tries work. Now it actually MEANS the
	  max number of steal tries, use 0 to disable (unlimited tries). [Skotlex]
2006/10/23
	* Added a bunch of important indexes when dealing with the log tables.
	  Added upgrade_svn9050.sql which adds these indexes as well. [Skotlex]
	* Expanded the family check to work as it should, exp-share-range is
	  respected, and the child is not considered for it (thanks to TheUltraMage
	  for the investigation) [Skotlex]
	* Double Casting will no longer fail when used. [Skotlex]
	* Modified SC_STONE so that the duration of the "petrifying" time is 5 secs
	  reduced by your natural resistance to petrify (which is mdef%) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the meaning of the third column in the skill_require_db. Instead
	  of MaxHP, this is now called MaxHPTrigger. This column (which was
	  previously unused by all skills) signals the limit HP% that you can have to
	  be able to use the skill. For example, setting it to 20 means the skill is
	  unusable if you have more than 20% life (note that this is merely a
	  threshold setting, it won't actually substract HP when used!) [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted LK_BERSERK so you can only use it when you have 20% or less
	  life. [Skotlex]
	* Removed NJ_TOBIDOUGU adding damage to W_HUUMA weapons which somehow got
	  readded. [Skotlex]
	* When nonplayers use Cloaking, it will be forced to level 10 since mobs
	  shouldn't have movement/attack restrictions while walking cloaked.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/10/20
	* Made HAMI_CASTLE use clif_slide rather than clif_fixpos. This should
	  fix clientside problems when castling between two positions the (client)
	  path finding can't find a walkable bath between anymore. [blackhole89]
	* Fixed the Homunc not spawning next to you after receiving it's data from
	  the char-server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Charge Atk being able to go through chasm/pits. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the homunculus DB information from the player structure to the
	  homun structure. Modified the homunculus creation packets to hold this
	  information during creation, also, all initial values are handled by the
	  map-server, the char server only assigns it a homun ID.  [Skotlex]
	  WARNING: This is yet untested! It's very possible something could had
	  broken after changing the format/size of the homunc creation packets.
	* Added config setting "summon_flora_setting", which it you can decide now
	  two things: a. Whether or not players can harm your floras outside versus
	  grounds, and b. Whether or not you can summon out and mix different types
	  of plants at the same time. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed pc_steal_item always failing to steal (it was attempting to
	  steal random item IDs...) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the mob on-death event so that when the killer is a
	  homunculus, it's master will be taken. Also, the variable killerrid will be
	  set before running the script to specify who delivered the final blow. If
	  the killerrid matches with the script attached player, you can be sure your
	  player did the final blow to the mob, otherwise, the attached player is who
	  did the most damage to the mob. [Skotlex]
2006/10/19
	* Cleaned up the log.c file. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed log_chat not recording anything if the server is compiled in SQL
	  mode and sql_logs is turned off (it should then record to a plain txt file)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SG_FRIEND, it should be triggering when Monks do Combo Finish (not
	  triple blows), and the trigger rate increase should be based on your known
	  level of SG_FRIEND, not TK_COUNTER. [Skotlex]
	* Phantasmic arrow now knockbacks even if it misses. [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted the way Monk combo times work. The combo time is now always
	  300ms (adjusted by combo_delay_rate) which takes effect inmediately AFTER
	  your current skill's canact-delay (which is why the particular skill delays
	  were moved to skillcast_db) [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_delayfix so it performs the can-act reduction from agi/dex
	  for combos there. [Skotlex]
	* Modified pc_steal_item so that it behaves more closely to the way it does
	  on Aegis. [Skotlex]
2006/10/18
	* Added a overflow check when calculating party exp share. [Skotlex]
2006/10/16
	* Adjusted UTSUSEMI/BUNSINJYUTSU so that they block range/melee weapon
	  attacks and only melee misc attacks. This isn't 100% correct, but it's a
	  better approximation to the way these skills behave. [Skotlex]
	* Emergency call &16 (disable skill from nowarpto maps) will now NOT block
	  Emergency Call if that map is also a gvg-castle map. Makes it safe to turn
	  on this option to prevent usage from special maps (like Lhz3) without
	  crippling the skill during WoE. [Skotlex]
	* Applied most of Mpeg's work on Ninja Skills. For information see:
	  http://gpegon.free.fr/ea/ninja_10-15-06_mpeg.txt [Skotlex]
	* When reinvoking a combo-time, the previous combo time will be terminated.
	  This could fix the ongoing difficulties pulling off Monk combos. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Esma-state not ending after casting it. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @hominfo displaying intimacy on a 1/10k scale. [Skotlex]
2006/10/14
	* Homun info window to show crit value. As default, homun does NOT crit,
	  as monsters do not crit. This is purely for display purpose for players
	  to identify their homon's luk value. [Vicious]
2006/10/13
	* Base attack for non players is now calculated as str + [str/10]^2 (it
	  does not has +dex/5+luk/5 which players do have) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the char-sql server trying to read the gms off a "gm_db" config
	  setting stead of "login_db" [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Throw Arrow/Musical Strike's damage formula [Skotlex]
	* Altered Trick Dead. It doesn't prevents skills from being casted on you
	  now, but damage-based skills will do no damage. [Skotlex]
	* Made the battle_config.attack_attr_none apply to pets when using the
	  "fixed damage" pet skill scripts. [Skotlex]
2006/10/12
	* made @killmonster make the mobs drop items again. [Skotlex]
	* Added a temporary message when Angel of the Sun, Moon and Stars trigger
	  so you know it triggered. [Skotlex]
	* When slaves_inherit_speed is set (which is also the default), homun will
	  have the same speed of their master when spawned. [Skotlex]
	* When using Hatred and you already have a hate target, your current hate
	  target is displayed now. [Skotlex]
2006/10/11
	* Cleaned up the char-server code when the last point of a player is not
	  found. First it'll check if there's any mapserver online, and then, if
	  there is, it'll look for the major cities. If this fails, then the player
	  will be told server is closed instead of trying to send him to a "random
	  map". Will fix the char-server printing the misleading message "map
	  server not found, sending to major city" when in reality there just
	  aren't any map servers connected. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the mob damagelog structure so that you can't exploit it by
	  switching characters. [Skotlex]
2006/10/09
	* Fixed crash when char-server sends to a "random" map-server online on
	  connect. Thanks to TheUltraMage for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed being petrified not reducing your defense and
	  increaseing your mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SC_NOCHAT printing the "skills are now available" message twice on
	  natural expiration. [Skotlex]
2006/10/08
	* Updated sql files [Playtester]
2006/10/06
	* Updated Land Protector to block absolutely every land-based skills with
	  the exception of Encores/Dances. [Skotlex]
	* Disabling status abnormalities will now reset a mob's target. [Skotlex]
	* Mob morphing also resets their target now. [Skotlex]
	* Monk combos no longer can ignore skill delay (delay skill for all their
	  combo-related skills is ASPD) [Skotlex]
	* Now you can trade while in a chatroom. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed homun-txt reading when the file has DOS line-type delimiters (\r\n)
	  [Skotlex]
2006/10/05
	* skill_blown will now trigger on-touch npcs on the landing tile. [Skotlex]
	* Max trade distance has been reduced from 5 to 2. [Skotlex]
	* Undisguising will now resend the cart-contents. [Skotlex]
	* Added function npc_unload_duplicates(), it unloads all npcs that are a
	  duplicate of the passed one. For use with @unloadnpc to prevent crashes
	  when you unload the npc that has duplicates. [Skotlex]
2006/10/04
	* Bowling bash now always hits twice regardless of situation. [Skotlex]
	* Added an underflow check to prevent sending to the client negative mdef2
	  value (for Frenzy'ed characters) [Skotlex]
	* Modified pc_jobchange so that it automatically removes
	  peco/falcon/cart/homun if the new job you are changing to does not possess
	  the required skill for them. [Skotlex]
2006/10/03
	* Fixed a possible crash with @reloadmobdb due to pet loot timers.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible crash and a memory leak on the login-SQL server when
	  parsing unban requests. [Skotlex]
	* Renamed setting delay_dependon_dex to delay_dependon_agi, the delay of
	  skills is reduced now (when enabled) by AGI instead of DEX, which makes a
	  lot more sense than DEX. [Skotlex]
2006/10/02
	* Modified item-granded status resistance reduction to behave as explained
	  by Vicious (Ragnarok Monthly magazine) [Skotlex]
	* Added the opt3 values to Eske [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the txt->sql converter only saving the very first character
	  permanent variable. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the txt->sql converter saving account-wide variables as
	  character-wide ones. [Skotlex]
	* Renamed nopenalty mapflag to noexppenalty. Using nopenalty will turn
	  on/off both noexppenalty and nozenypenalty now. [Skotlex]
2006/10/01
	* Removed the speed adjustment per level of Increase/Decrease Agility
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed humunculi skill exploit, thanks to mr.rkit [Lupus]
2006/09/30
	* Rewrote the txt->sql converter. It now links directly to the char server
	  files so that it should get auto-updated with any code changes in the
	  later. [Skotlex]
	* The converter will now also convert: account-wide variables, parties,
	  guilds, guild storage and guild castles. At this point the only two things
	  not converted are login-server-wide account variables (##, they belong to
	  the login converter) and homunculus (the SQL save function is messy and
	  doesn't lends itself to be integrated with the converter the way all the
	  other functions are). [Skotlex]
	* misceffect2 will no longer cause the effect on top of the source object
	  when it is the fake npc. [Skotlex]
	* Added check so that Frost Nova doesn't hides hitting animation on
	  targets. [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing brackets around the trade logs condition check, thanks
	  to Coltaro. [Skotlex]
2006/09/29
	* Spurt state will now trigger on Soul Linkers as well. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check un unit_run when unit_walktoxy fails. Should fix running
	  getting you stuck sometimes when running on diagonals near obstacles.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/28
	* Merged the necessary changes to make the script engine support negative
	  constants (db/const.txt). Thanks to Rayce (from jA) for the code. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the skill.c code to take into account when skill_unitsetting
	  returns null (skill failed), fixes a possible crash with Wand of Hermode
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/27
	* Cleaned up status_get_party/guild_id, it should also fix a possible crash
	  when invoking such a functio on a masterless pet. [Skotlex]
	* Sharp-Shooting will now display a skill animation. [Skotlex]
	* The no_spawn_on_player setting will now also work for static mobs, but
	  only if the setting is set to 100 or higher. [Skotlex]
2006/09/26
	* Yet again messed with the packet sent during a splash attack, but this
	  time taking into account the packets that eA was using some many revisions
	  ago. Tests are needed to see if Magnum Break/Grimtooth don't spam the skill
	  animation anymore, and to see if GrandCross didn't break it's animation as
	  well. [Skotlex]
	* Added function skill_dance_switch which handles converting overlapping
	  song/dances to dissonance/ugly dance. It should make the overlapping area
	  now behave completely like the mentioned song/dances (taking into account
	  interval and target type changes). [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target so that non-offensive skills cannot be used
	  on a homun except for the homun and it's master. [Skotlex]
	* Steal zeny won't work on treasure chests now. [Skotlex]
2006/09/25
	* Added an ugly check so that Heal will display 0 when healing a berserked
	  character (and it will again display full heal amount when healing a player
	  who's at full life) [Skotlex]
	* Disabled again client-self-muting since it's causing too much trouble.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Merged FlavioJS's script patch which should fix stuff like "mes ();"
	  causing crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Item group reading will now complain when a line doesn't has enough
	  fields. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed #baselevelup adding instead of substracting status points when used
	  with negative levels. Also made it reset your stats if there wasn't enough
	  to substract from. [Skotlex]
	* Applied FlavioJS's suggestion of expanding WFIFOPOS to also take the
	  direction. This had the side effect of fixing the direction missing from
	  the mob spawn packet, which explains why all npcs face north when you are
	  within sight while doing a @reloadscript. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the order of packets in TK_HIGHJUMP, may fix the reports of
	  getting stuck when jumping into a warp. [Skotlex]
	* Changed a bit the code of marionette control, where a redefined local
	  variable may be the cause of mob-targetted Marionette Control stacking
	  stats up. [Skotlex]
2006/09/24
	* When the code auto-guesses that a skill should require ammo, it will
	  accept any type of ammo for using it instead of only arrows. Fixes Magnum
	  Break usage on Gunslingers. [Skotlex]
2006/09/22
	* Probably fixed a signed/unsigned mismatch warning on the new socket code.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the "map server claims to have char online, but this other map
	  server also has it tagged as online" message triggering in some cases where
	  it shouldn't. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some maps in db/mapindex.txt being under the wrong id and added comments
	  so this will not happen again. [Zephiris]
	  --- ATTENTION! ---
	  People running TXT servers will have to tell their players to redo their /memo
	  points since the map ids of the old file were wrong.
2006/09/21
	* Fixed a bug on "select" when skipping empty entries when the selected
	  entry is the last. [Skotlex]
	* Improved a bit RFIFOFLUSH as suggested by Harbin. [Skotlex]
2006/09/20
	* A mob's HP is set temporarily to 0 before invoking it's on-death script,
	  prevents said scripts being able to "rekill" the mob indefinitely (if stuff
	  like killmonster is used within) [Skotlex]
	* Some small cleanups in chat.c [Skotlex]
	* Fixed party_sub_count (TK_POWER) failing when the idle_no_share setting
	  was disabled. [Skotlex]
	* Enabled Star Gladiators and Soul Linkers to do /doridori [Skotlex]
2006/09/19
	* Fixed nocommand mapflag causing the "you can't use commands on this map"
	  message to trigger one very single chat, instead of only for actual @/#
	  command invocation. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for skipping empty string menu entries for the select()
	  command (just as `menu` has it already) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_set_hate_mob letting you place mobs on any of the three
	  positions regardless of size [Skotlex]
	* The double continuation error will now display both scripts that
	  triggered it. [Skotlex]
	* Loading the storage from the char-server will fail if player is already
	  tagged in final save state. [Skotlex]
	* Removed setting ban_spoof_namer, sending invalid global-talk packets will
	  now just kick the player out of the server. [Skotlex]
	* Added echoing messages back to self when using @/# commands on whispers
	  and party/guild messages, to prevent the client from muting yourself.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some gcc4 warnings [Toms]
2006/09/18
	* Fixed Spider Web fire damage bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Made Global chat always reply back to you even on @/# commands, this
	  prevents the client from muting yourself due to "hack". However, this same
	  fix isn't easily applicable to @ commands invoked from whispers or
	  party/guild messages, those are still pending. [Skotlex]
	* Merged Meruru's update to socket.c, which includes a rewritten parse
	  function, which should hopefully be more efficient than the previous code.
	  [Skotlex]
	* The new code includes support for two config settings
	  (packet_athena.txt): frame_size, which can be used to alter the logic
	  packet-size allowed by the code, and mode_neg, which when set to yes, sets
	  TCP_NODELAY on all connections (defaults to yes). [Skotlex]
	* High-Jump is usable everywhere now, except that on maps where it
	  previously failed, now will just make you jump in place. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed TK_RUN as per packets provided by AuronX. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the equipment/card resistances to status ailments outside of
	  status_get_sc_def, so that they are applied only to rate, not duration.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified the Asura code (again), hopefully movement sprite issues are
	  fixed now [Skotlex]
	* @reloadscript scripts will no longer eliminate mobs with no respawn data.
	  But watch out for possible bugs (I think someone mentioned 1 extra
	  treasure box will spawn when you use it? This needs testing!) [Skotlex]
	* Made speed_add_rate a linearly stacking increase. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected a possible overflow when using show_mob_info to display the
	  mob's up as a percent. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the documentation for checkoption/checkoption1/checkoption2
	  [Skotlex]
	* Reenabled client requesting to self mute, as the whole knockback packet
	  issues of the past which were causing players to mute themselves when being
	  knockback is no longer there. [Skotlex]
2006/09/17
	* Fixed NPC_INVISIBLE's cloak ending after attacking once. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SG_FUSION being castable without Soul Link state. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the item-use restriction SC checks from clif.c to pc_use_item,
	  fixed Gravitation blocking potion usage on it's area of effect. [Skotlex]
	* Sphere Marines and Summoned Flora are now inmune to class-changing.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/16
	* Added monster_ai&256. When set, a monster will pick a random starting
	  position to begin checking versus it's skills, otherwise, it will always
	  begin checking from the beginning. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the status change duration reduction equation was was totally
	  wrong, thanks to k3dt [Skotlex]
2006/09/15
	* Now mobs won't do a distance check to lose their target on every ai
	  iteration, but only when they finish walking (unless you set monster_ai&1)
	  [Skotlex]
	* The chase distance before a mob gives up following a player has been
	  increased from view-size (range2) to min-chase (range3). [Skotlex]
	* Reverted the Summon Flora change where all plants were being summoned in
	  one go. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the weapon repair effect to where it belongs (after successfully
	  repairing an item) [Skotlex]
	* Added config setting "friend_auto_add" (battle/player.conf), if set, when
	  you accept someone as your friend, both characters will show up on each
	  other's friend list. [Skotlex]
2006/09/14
	* Changed Extremity Fist's code to make you actually walk past your target,
	  which displays a much more correct "animation" for the skill. Thanks to
	  HiddenDragon for the information and code. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the item_db search functions so that when returning the
	  dummy-item, it first updates the nameid to match the requested one, this
	  prevents pc_additem later on giving you an item with ID 500 instead of the
	  ID requested. [Skotlex]
	* Added a clif_skill_nodamage packet when using Repair Weapon, just to see
	  what happens. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed "half" of the alliance being saved, which ends up in guilds
	  that can attack another, but not viceversa. [Skotlex]
	* Added deleting of saved Status changes on character delete for the
	  Char-TXT server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the can-act delay never being checked when requesting to use
	  Homunculus Skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed warmth skills draining SP of the target, not the caster. [Skotlex]
	* When TK_DODGE triggers, it will no longer delay your attack or movement.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Estimation /Sense/ whatever will no longer hide the vit bonus to mdef2,
	  as reported by Playtester. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Summon Flora to summon the max number of possible plants on one
	  cast. It will consume as many bottles as monsters summoned. Also cleaned up
	  the function to be usable by non players. [Skotlex]
	* Shadow Jump no longer goes over walls. [Skotlex]
	* battle_calc_gvg_damage will be invoked in gvg maps regardless of woe
	  time. [Skotlex]
	* NPC_MENTALBREAKER now zaps matk*lv SP based on observations by Tharis.
	  [Skotlex]
	* md->class_ will be changed on mob-class-change to fix all class-change
	  related bugs. On respawn, the spawn data will be used to revert to the
	  original class. [Skotlex]
	* Improved the pet skillbonus timer for "eternal bonuses" cases where the
	  bonus delay is 0. [Skotlex]
2006/09/13
	* SC_CHANGE cannot override itself anymore. This fixes being able to
	  "recast" the skill while it's still active to lengthen the duration AND
	  reheal the target. [Skotlex]
	* Changed a bit the dnsbl lookup in the login servers to make it faster.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Moved the pc rate modifiers from items
	  (hp/sp/matk/hit/flee/cri/flee2/def2/mdef2/def/def2/speed) from
	  status_calc_bl_sub_pc to status_calc_pc, as it simplifies code vastly, and
	  also fixes Osiris card not applying to said bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_damage_delay_rate not working, thanks to Orn. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the nocommand mapflag so you can specify the GM range that is
	  blocked from using commands (eg: "prontera.gat mapflag nocommand 40"
	  disables commands to characters in the GM range 0~39) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the char-server TXT whisper system to use the online_db to know
	  to which map server forward whispers, instead of just sending the whisper
	  to every map server. [Skotlex]
	* Readded the setting TCP_NODELAY on socket.c to see if it fixes the
	  walk-lag issue. [Skotlex]
2006/09/12
	* Modified the login SQL server so that case insensitive lookups use "where
	  name = BINARY 'name'" instead of "where BINARY name = 'name'", since this
	  way the name index should be used, and performance will no longer be
	  heavily affected. [Skotlex]
	* Modified main.sql to add 4 missing indexes (thanks to ErkDog): char_id on
	  the tables memo/friends, and online/name on the char table. Added
	  upgrade_svn8728.sql to add these indexes to already existing tables.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated convert_engine.sql to use TYPE instead of ENGINE to be compatible
	  with Mysql 4 installations. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the morph restrictions from skill_additional_effect to
	  mob_class_change, so that SA_MONOCELL will not convert clones, emperium, or
	  treasure boxes. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed 'range' might be used uninitialized warning [Toms]
	* Added Jaguar's sql script to convert all tables to MyISAM. It's located
	  in sql-files/convert_engine.sql WARNING: Using MyISAM is much faster than
	  InnoDB, but you are strongly recommended to backup your database before
	  switching engines since we don't know if eA is fully coded to work
	  correctly with MyISAM yet. [Skotlex]
	* Added manual deletion of sc_data entries when deleting a character
	  (char-SQL) [Skotlex]
	* Updated main.sql to use pure MyISAM tables, removed all foreign keys.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_switch to use strncmpi instead of strcmpi, it makes it so
	  using "yessir" will match "yes", this is actually needed because if you set
	  a config setting to "yes " (notice the trailing space), then the map config
	  engine fails to read it right, and will set the config setting to 0 (no).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to hate_mob cleanup when triggering the Angel stuff. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the show_mob_info setting to add another space to the separating
	  pipes, so that each field is separated by " | " instead of " |". [Skotlex]
	* Homunculus intimacy will go back to 500 on evolution. [Skotlex]
	* Baphomet splash damage will now hit nearby enemies regardless of flee
	  (but the initial attack still has to connect for the splash to trigger)
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/11
	* Modified set_nonblocking and setsocketoptions in socket.c, using eApp's
	  code as reference. Hopefully should improve performance somewhat. [Skotlex]
	* Added a comment explaining what a comment is to login/char/map config
	  files, as well as the main script config file. [Skotlex]
	* Modified SG_FEEL so that it works the same way that in Aegis
	  (packet-wise) [Skotlex]
	* Added a comment to explain how to "remove" a string variable from the
	  msg_athena entries. [Skotlex]
	* Summoned and slave mobs won't show up on @showmobs anymore. [Skotlex]
	* Moved Spider Web damage bonus from battle_calc_damage to battle_attr_fix,
	  so that damage will be doubled based on the actual attack element.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted autospell cards to trigger only on physical weapon attacks.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted a bit the heal code, it should now show either the full heal
	  amount, or 0, depending on whether the target was healed at all or not
	  (this also means it shows 0 if you try to heal a full-life character.. but
	  it's the closest I've gotten to make it display 0 on Berserked chars)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Memorize will be consumed even on instant cast spells now. [Skotlex]
	* Berserk will end now if hit and remaining hp is less or equal to 100.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Guild Aura will be removed on sc-load to prevent Guild Masters from
	  getting that bonus from the old implementation. [Skotlex]
	* Added D-Kalck's fix of the TXT -> SQL converter [Playtester]
2006/09/10
	* Thanks to KarLaeda, added missing function in @showmobs [Lupus]
	- Script function 'query_sql': In the TXT version it doesn't fill the array
	  and always return -1. Added for scripts compatibility. Your scripts
	  won't crash in TXT version. They can work it around.
		I suggest we need a function getversion()
	* Updated item_db.sql and mob_db.sql [Playtester]
2006/09/09
	* Added a crash protection in case mapfreeblock unlock tries to free a null
	  pointer. [Skotlex]
	* Moved perfect_hiding from state to special_state, so that it clears out
	  when you remove your pet. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed the Taekwon Rest skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a npc-timer memory leak on npc_unload ("[Warning]: ers_obj_destroy:
	  X entries missing, continuing destruction. Manager for entries of size
	  16.") [Skotlex]
2006/09/08
	* Unified the rest and ganster paradise code into a single function.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Moved the Happy State trigger to the regen function, it now triggers at
	  the same time SPTIME does. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up SG_HATE, hope it works now. [Skotlex]
	* Removed sg_miracle_skill_duration, replaced it with
	  sg_miracle_skill_min_duration and sg_miracle_skill_max_duration, to specify
	  a range for the duration of the skill. [Skotlex]
	* Added upgrade_svn8675.sql in case, for some reason, your guild table
	  still has the emblem_data field as a 'blob' with "NOT NULL" specified.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed alliance/opposition making not cancelling out map-server-side when
	  the guild already had max number of alliances/oppositions (thanks to k3dt)
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/07
	* Fixed SC_BERSERK setting Hp to 100 when dispelled by unnatural means (eg:
	  wand of hermod) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the doridori parse clif function. [Skotlex]
	* Merged some of mpeg's work on NJ skills [Skotlex]
	* Removed the Warmth "stacking" code. [Skotlex]
	* Added back the effect of /doridori to skill-SP regen [Skotlex]
	* Implemented a rough version of Angel of the Sun/Moon/Stars, it has a low
	  chance of triggering on doridori-boosted SP-regen events. However, it has
	  no client-side messages yet (need to add these in) [Skotlex]
	* Added sg_angel_skill_ratio to specify rate at which the Angel skill
	  triggers. [Skotlex]
	* Added unit_cancel_combo which takes care of ending a combo time and
	  resuming normal attack 'inmediately' [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some the SG_HATE code, you can't change hate targets anymore.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/06
	* Fixed the memset in status_calc_pc, corrects some mysterious bugs such as
	  item-drop bonuses suddenly not working anymore. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected SC_INCREASEAGI and SC_DECREASEAGI speed-change formula.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Aex Aeterna ending on Soul Breaker's first half. [Skotlex]
	* Applied Orn's modification on speed increases/reductions with increase/
	decrease agi [Toms] 
2006/09/05
	* Removed setting mob_show_hp, it's been replaced now by mob_show_info,
	  which can be used to specify what kind of info should be displayed from a
	  mob. Current options are two different formats for Hp display, and current
	  level (monster.conf). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Signum Crucis Def reduction being 10+2*lv% instead of 10+4*lv%
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied the Ultra Mage's suggestion to have the map server strip trailing
	  spaces/comments from the config files. It will also now print out when an
	  unknown config setting is found. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status change resistance not being invoked at all for pretty much
	  all cases. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected SC_INTRAVISION not starting. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when attempting to read a Label as a string on a script
	  (thanks to End of Exam) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possible crash when changing a chat-room's owner (thanks to End of
	  Exam) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed dispell removing SC_NOCHAT [Skotlex]
	* Small fix which should correct skill_attack damaging hidden characters
	  when it shouldn't. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed connect_until field being a smallint rather than int in the login
	  table (upgrade with upgrade_svn8630.sql) [Skotlex]
2006/09/04
	* Fixed crash when using Adaptation during an Encore. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed manner being reset to 0 on logout while muted.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed status_get_sc_tick, duration and chance are now both handled by
	  status_get_sc_def (this means status change duration and success rate
	  both will always follow the very same formula) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob-kill experience getting screwed up when characters who did
	  damage die/logout at the moment the mob dies. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed "sleep", thanks to Lance for figuring out the error.
	  [Skotlex]
	* SC_REFLECTSHIELD will now be passed to devoted characters at cast-time.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to make a mob's level 1 if the read level from the db is
	  less than it. [Skotlex]
	* status_calc_misc will now be invoked in status_calc_bl even on the first
	  call, since status could have gone up due to skill bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Moved max HP/SP calculations to before invoking status_calc_misc
	  [Skotlex]
	* Simplified distance and check_distance to use "aegis" methods (greater of
	  dx/dy = distance), there's a new define in map.h called CIRCULAR_AREA, when
	  set, the previous method is used, and "for each in range" calls will also
	  check for distances, making most ground skills and battle system use real
	  circles instead of squares. [Skotlex]
2006/09/03
	* Fixed SC_BERSERK's no regen penalty lasting pretty much forever.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/09/02
	* SC_REGENERATION's val4 now holds the RGN flag of what is blocked rather
	  than blocking all types of regen. [Skotlex]
	* LK_BERSERK will now only block natural regen on state-end. [Skotlex]
	* SC_EXTREMITYFIST/SC_DANCING/SC_EXPLOSIONSPIRITS will only block natural
	  sp regen and not skill regen [Skotlex]
	* SC_REGENERATION blocking will be cancelled on logout now. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected SCB_LUK not updating SCB_BATK as well. [Skotlex]
2006/09/01
	* Corrected script_commands description of getequipid, it returns -1, not 0
	  on fail. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the mob-id check during pet_db loading, it will also now print when
	  a pet is not loaded due to having an invalid mob class specified. [Skotlex]
	* The "delete_timer error/no such timer" report will now print the related function [Toms]
	* The Clearing unused stack report will now print the related NPC [Toms]
	* The duplicate npc report will now print the related file name [Toms]
	* Added config setting "partial_name_scan", which specifies whether @ given
	  names should use a partial string lookup or absolute name lookup. Defaults
	  to no (gm.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Expanded status_calc_misc so it may also calculate the batk of characters
	  as well as their regen data (if they have it) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak when using charsave_method:1 [Skotlex]
	* Soul Breaker will now be affected by Lex Aeterna on both parts of the
	  attack. [Skotlex]
	* Status changes with no skill and no SCB* data will now go through if they
	  have an SI* icon. This should fix SC_MIRACLE [Skotlex]
	* Reverted switching a mob's adelay/amotion when the later is longer than
	  the former, now both get updated to amotion. [Skotlex]
2006/08/31
	* Moved the intimacy penalty of HFLI_SBR44 and HVAN_EXPLOSION to
	  skill_counter_additional_effect [Skotlex]
	* Simplified skillnotok_hom by using an invocation to skillnotok [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed BD_ADAPTATION [Skotlex]
	* Homun won't lose any intimacy on death now. [Skotlex]
	* Homun will be saved together with the master now (as long as the homun is
	  active) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the error reporting in map_freeblock_unlock so that when there's
	  an error, the reported line number is the file's linenumber plus the
	  object's type *10000. This is for debug information to help track down the
	  already-freed error. [Skotlex]
	* pc_adopt will now preserve the kid's job/job-level/experience. This means
	  that if you adopt a Swordman level 45, it will become a baby-swordman level
	  45, with the exact same exp as before. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed new mob's name not sent to the client when the mob is morphed [Toms]
	* Added setting attack_walk_delay which specifies whether a character
	  should (or not) be able to move inmediately after starting a normal attack
	  (battle.conf). Defaults to 0 since that's what Aegis uses. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @summon's delete timer being screwed up. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the summon script command. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the clone script command's delete-timer being screwed up. [Skotlex]
2006/08/30
	* Skill required-state will now only be checked on cast-begin, not
	  cast-end. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check in status_calc_pc to prevent player rate adjustments from
	  from going below 0. [Skotlex]
	* Removed sending normal-damage packets instead of skill packets for
	  splash-damaged skills, since... well, that's how Aegis does it. [Skotlex]
	* Updated HLIF_CHANGE to work as explained by Tharis -> It now adds 30*lv
	  vit and 20*lv int, is dispelled on warp, and can-act delay is 5+5*lv
	  minutes. Hp/Sp is no longer set to 10 after a forced expiration. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed up char-sql compilation. [Skotlex]
	* Added a message to @clearweather stating when climate changes will
	  dispel. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected @hidenpc saying that it's command name was "@npcoff" [Skotlex]
	* Updated itemdb reading on the char-sql server so that it reads both
	  item_db and item_db2 files (totally untested yet) [Skotlex]
2006/08/29
	* Added printing out whenever the irc-module attempts to connect, to debug
	  whether the map-server lag is due to this or not. [Skotlex]
	* Mobs will now always chase players using hard-path seeks. [Skotlex]
	* monster_ai&1 now only signals whether mobs should update their target
	  cell while chasing more frequently (rather than being state-driven like
	  Aegis) [Skotlex]
	* Changed the defaults of view_range_rate and chase_range_rate to 120 to
	  aproximate better Aegis's view ranges (which are square areas and not
	  circles) [Skotlex]
	* Applied Mpeg's work on GS [Toms]
	  ( http://gpegon.free.fr/ea/gunslinger_08-29-06_mpeg.txt )
	* Fixed a syntax error in @showmobs [Toms]
	* Added @showmobs. It shows selected mobs on your mini-map (excluding
	  mini-bosses & MVP) thanks to KarLaeda for the command [Lupus]
2006/08/28
	* Modified the dancing code and Moonlit Petals in particular, so that it is
	  treated as an ensemble like any other, it will just knockback people when
	  they step into it. [Skotlex]
	* The memory leak reports will now print out in the logs also the revision
	  they belong to. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the scriptable npc-shop code, it should be crash-proof now.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added TK level-up buffs to SG too, and extended them to 10 min [DracoRPG]
	* Added "Barefeet Mastery" effect to TK_RUN (thanks Tharis for both) [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the produce_db format, now there's a skill-lv column right after
	  the skill-id column to specify required skill-level to craft this item.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified the skill produce_db code to take into account the new skill-lv
	  requirement. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed exp bonuses applying twice for the job-exp [Skotlex]
	* @reloadbattleconf  will now also update the ragsrvinfo table on the
	  char-server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed homun hp/sp growth rates stacking with HP/SP passive increasing
	  skills. [Skotlex]
2006/08/27
	* Fixed undefined reference to 'malloc_set' in log.c [Toms]
	* Updated svn-revision reading, now it can read the new svn file system [Toms]
	* Fixed a bug with homunc which could spawn on a non-walkable cell [Toms]
2006/08/26
	* Optional macro MEMSET_TURBO for faster low-level memory initializations. [Lance]
	* Small bug fix in read_homunculus_expdb (a warning was always displayed) [Toms]
	* Small adjustment on the mob_ai code which could fix mobs not chasing you
	  if you hit them from the maximum possible diagonal distance. [Skotlex]
2006/08/25
	* Cleaned some the skill unit removal added flag so that it signals whether
	  the skill is being force-removed, or it has "naturally expired". [Skotlex]
	* The following skills will display a normal attack animation now:
	  NPC_WATERATTACK, NPC_GROUNDATTACK, NPC_FIREATTACK, NPC_WINDATTACK,
	  NPC_POISONATTACK, NPC_HOLYATTACK, NPC_DARKNESSATTACK,
	  NPC_TELEKINESISATTACK, NPC_SPLASHATTACK
	* Skills that require a weapon and consume spirit spheres will no longer be
	  auto-tagged to require ammo. [Skotlex]
	* Now MISC skills with delay 0 will also use the attack delay (if the skill
	  is tagged to do damage) [Skotlex]
	* Added script commands roclass/eaclass to enable scripts to access eA's
	  job format. Read script_commands.txt and ea_job_system.txt for a more
	  complete explanation of how this job system works. [Skotlex]
	* Added a flag to skill_delunitgroup, skill_delunit & skill_unit_onlimit.
	  If 1 is passed, it will avoid UNT_WARP_ACTIVE to be transformed in 
	  UNT_WARP_WAITING and will destroy it. [Toms]
	  ( To avoid such crash : http://www.eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=114102 
	  when the code need an empty slot and the oldest one is UNT_WARP_ACTIVE )
2006/08/24
	* Little cleanup on homunc's code [Toms]
	* Modified @reloadmobdb & @reloadskilldb to reload homunc's db too [Toms] 
	* Now when a mob's adelay is set to be less than the amotion, both values
	  will be swapped (this is an attempt to understand how those mobs actually
	  work on aegis) [Skotlex]
	* script command "isrefine" will no longer return always false for equip
	  positions above 6 (this has not been needed since the addition of the
	  refine column to tbe item_db many months ago) [Skotlex]
	* Added NPC_CRITICALSLASH to the list of skills that display as a normal
	  attack. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted the previous change, changed the pet capture code to try to
	  capture a mob based on their view class rather than actual class.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the md->class_ variable not being updated when a mob's class is
	  changed. [Skotlex]
	* Added setting clear_skills_on_warp to specify when a character's
	  land-based skills are deleted when the caster changes maps. Defaults to all
	  types. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed Brandish Spear not passing the flag to skill_attack,
	  causing it to do miserable damage. [Skotlex]
	* Warp Portal will no longer be removed when caster steps through it (this
	  is left to the new clear_skills_on_warp setting) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up status_percent_change to switch equations when the target has
	  high hp to prevent overflows, also it will directly take hp/maxhp when a
	  rate of 100 or higher is passed to prevent calculations. [Skotlex]
	* Traps and Land Elemental fields are no longer automatically removed on
	  map change (handled now by clear_skills_on_warp) [Skotlex]
	* traps_setting &2 no longer does anything (handled now by blah blah)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied some change from mpeg on Ninja Skills [Toms]
	* Put HVAN_Explosion based on max_hp instead of current hp [Toms]
2006/08/23
	* Fixed mob_clone_spawn completely ignoring the mode variable. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Energy Coat reducing and consuming more than it should when you
	  have 100% SP [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up getmapxy script function, also added support for type 4 so
	  that it returns a player's homunculus position if such exists. [Skotlex]
	* SC_ARMOR_ELEMENT looks like gone away from status_change_start since ... rev 6791.
	  Try to reimplement it. [Toms]
	* Fixed HVAN_EXPLOSION [Skotlex]
	* Frost Nova won't display a nodamage skill packet (still need to sort out
	  a way to fix the splash damaged packets) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible SIGSEGV on buildin_maprespawnguildid if the map is unknown [Toms]
	* Added debug on "Inifity loop" to know which script is making this loop [Toms]
2006/08/22
	* More fixes to the splash code. Kamaitachi and Sharpshooting should
	  display correctly now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash on the mobspawn script command. [Skotlex]
	* Made SC_FLEET increase batk as well as watk. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed gcc warning [Toms]
	* Fixed AM_REST not closing the homunc status window [Toms]
	* Fixed SC_NEN according to Mpeg [Toms]
	* Added a ShowStatus("Terminating...\n") on login-server_sql [Toms]
	* Some corrections to make Tatami Gaeshi work correctly. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SBR44 doing 100% more damage than it should. [Skotlex]
	* Some more work on the splash skill code. Now splash-damaged enemies
	  should show no animation at all, just the damage-number, while only the
	  targetted character should still display the full skill animation.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified the homun-txt file-save format to separate the name from the
	  rest of fields with tabs (like character saving does), this may fix homun
	  save/loading when using non-latin characters on the name, but be warned
	  that it also means the previous homun-data files are lost! (unless you
	  replace the comma before the start of a name with a tab) [Skotlex]
	* getnameditem will now also work on stackable items [Skotlex]
	* Corrected battle_calc_weapon_attack so that all skills ignore your
	  left-hand weapon, and that the Katar's double-attack damage bonus for the
	  offhand damage applies ONLY on normal attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Resurrect Homunculus's % to 20*lv% [Skotlex]
 	* Added SQL update which should remove \' from guild names [Toms]
	* Added option to disable character deletion of certain levels [Lupus]
		check char_athena.conf for this option format
2006/08/21
	* Some more cleaning up of the splash skill code. Now the passed hit value
	  for the splash targetted mobs is 9 instead of 5, this allows multi-hitting
	  splash skills to display the number of hits correctly. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed call homunc bug when the homunc was vapo and the master has change
	  of map [Toms]
	* Fixed SQL-Guild Creation, guild name was escaped 2 times [Toms]
	* Some cleaning of the splash skills. Updated skill-attack to enable again
	  passing of flag 0xF000 which signals that the skill level sent to the
	  client should be -1 (no skill name shouted). Should (hopefully) clear/clean
	  up a bunch of splash damage skill animation-related packets. [Skotlex]
	* Homun saving won't cap hp/sp to max hp/sp since a homun can have higher
	  hp/sp than the one stated in the db (due to skill bonuses or status
	  changes) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some more the regen_data structure, so that
	  skill/sitting-skill related data is optional (since only players have it).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed AM_RESURRECTION, thanks to RockmanEXE for %HP values [Toms]
	* Fixed HAMI_CASTLE, HAMI_DEFENCE & HLIF_AVOID [Toms]
	* Adjusted Glittering's success rate to 20+10*lv% [Skotlex]
	* Corrected isequipped() so that cards will not be tagged as "used up"
	  unless all the specified items were found. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a confusion in skill_attack using the src instead of dsrc for some
	  calls, which was causing some problems with the KAITE check from AoE
	  spells. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed ASC_BREAKER's misc damage part not having the ignore-element flag
	  set. [Skotlex]
	* Moved homunc battle conf from misc.conf to homunc.conf [Toms]
	* Some cleaning in skill.c in regard to homun skills. [Skotlex]
	* Madness Canceller now stacks with other aspd bonuses, just like Berserk
	  does. [Skotlex]
	* Removed config setting "muting_players", and expanded the manner_system
	  config to specify how having negative manner (mute) affects a player (see
	  battle/misc.conf). [Skotlex]
	* Expanded the pk_mode setting from no/yes to 0/1/2. 1 is normal pk_mode,
	  if 2 is used, it makes killing players give you a loss of 5 manner points.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed WS_WEAPONREFINE always failing when at less than job 50. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Autosave routine not working when there's only one player
	  online. [Skotlex]
	* Disabled command @rain since the client no longer supports it anyway.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed delitem not checking for the first slot's card, also optimized it
	  so that it doesn't checks on the other slots. [Skotlex]
2006/08/20
	* Added a check during mob_db loading so that the six basic stats, max hp
	  and max sp are never below 1, as this could cause crashes when using
	  certain skills. [Skotlex]
	* Gravitation now only blocks the caster from using potions. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Madness Canceller letting you walk while the effect lasts.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Splitted yet again ASC_BREAKER into a two-part attack. This time the
	  int-based damage is a MISC type attack, and gets reduced by skills as such.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "int format, long unsigned int arg" warning [Toms]
	* Fixed a warning when using cap_value(x, 0, x) on an unsigned value [Toms]
	* Added clif_skill_fail for homunc to skill_castend_id & skill_castend_pos [Toms]
	* Fixed homunc skill 8016 not considered as homunc skill [Toms]
	* @useskill will now cause your homun to use the skill instead of you if
	  the skill is a Homun skill and you have an active homunculus. [Skotlex]
	* Reduced the Success Chance of GS_FLING to 10+10*lv% (Playtester told me
	  that Vicious told him the chance was much lower like that) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some Homunc issues with HR servers (capping some values) [Toms]
	* Added @hominfo command to obtain real values (not capped ones) [Toms]
2006/08/19
	* Fixed @homlvup bug [Toms]
	* Fixed AM_REST & AM_RESU consumming SP if they fail [Toms]
	* Fixed homunc spawning bug (they was spawned after an AM_REST + master warp for example)[Toms]
	* Fixed GS_GROUNDDRIFT [Skotlex]
	* Increased chance of GS_DESPERADO connecting to 20% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed battle_calc_base_damage being called for the left hand even for
	  non-dual-wielding attacks. left-hand damage was being set to 0 later
	  anyway, so no exploit existed. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the weapon_atk_rate bonus to battle_calc_base_damage so that it'll
	  apply correctly when dual-wielding different types of weapons. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed job-mask 0x100000 in the item_db enabling Dancers/Bards to use the
	  items (0x80000 should be for them and 0x100000 should be currently unused)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible sigsegv when deleting lif under Mental Change [Toms]
	* Fixed HAMI_CASTLE [Toms]
	* Fixed HLIF_CHANGE [Toms]
	* Updated HLIF_BRAIN skill [Toms]
	* Fixed homunculus intimacy on feeding [Toms]
	* Added homunculus_friendly_rate battle config [Toms]
	* Some compilation warnings fixed [Toms]
	* Added skill's required item check on homunc skills [Toms]
	* Add Condensed Red Potion as a required item for HLIF_HEAL [Toms]
2006/08/18
	* Little code cleanup on last fix [Toms]
	* Fixed HLIF_HEAL healing the homunc instead of the master [Toms]
	* Fixed HLIF_AVOID not increasing walk speed of master [Toms]
	* Fixed the atk_rate (Turtle General Card) bonus not working on
	  dual-wielders. [Skotlex]
	* Made HLIF_HEAL a self skill that auto-selects target to caster's master.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Implemented SC_BLOODLUST and SC_CHANGE, cleaned up HLIF_CHANGE [Skotlex]
	* Applied a correction to HVAN_EXPLOSION [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Homun ASPD calculation being able to underflow and give you min
	  speed. [Skotlex]
	* Added monster_ai&128 to make aggressive mobs ignore that behaviour of
	  always picking Homun targets above player targets regardless of who is
	  closer. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed homun info packet being unable to display HP/SP correctly once the
	  values are above 32k. [Skotlex]
	* Applied Mpeg's work on ninja [Toms]
	* Fixed @homlvup [Toms]
	* Added guild_aura (skill.conf) setting so you can specify when it works
	  and if it works on the guild-master itself. Defaults to working all the
	  time on everyone except GM. [Skotlex]
	* Little code cleanup [Toms]
	* Cleaned merc_hom_evolution to avoid free'ing/realloc'ing [Toms]
	* Fixed "args of aFree is freed pointer" on Homunc deletion [Toms]
	* Changed unit_free so that it receives which cleartype should be used when
	  the character is still on a map. Used this on status_damage so that mobs
	  that do not respawn when killed will properly display the death animation.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Energy Coat consuming 10x less SP per hit than it should.
	* Fixed signed/unsigned comparison issues with natural heal system [Toms]
2006/08/17
	* Vaporize will no fail when the homun is dead. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected thhe double free issue that occurs when a homun dies and has no
	  intimacy left. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the charsave_method:1 saving/loading exp as signed ints rather than
	  unsigned. [Skotlex]
	* Applied use of structure regen_data for a unified regen module. Natural
	  and skill-heal is handled by this structure, while sitting-skill-heal is
	  still player dependant (mostly because the other object types can't sit)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the status calc code for homun by moving it from
	  status_calc_bl_sub_homun to status_calc_homun (where it should had always
	  been) [Skotlex]
	* Updated SQL files [Playtester]
	* Corrected map_random_dir algorithm [Toms]
	* Fixed homunc natural heal and little code cleanup [Toms]
	* Changed AM_CALLHOMUN Skill to spawn the homunc at 1 cell from his master [Toms]
2006/08/16
	* Fixed being unable to recast Adrenaline Rush to reset the duration
	  timers. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up skill_get_range2 so that using range 0 for non-self skills
	  uses the caster's attack range. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed AM_CALLHOMUN checking for an embryo when you have a vaporized
	  homun. [Skotlex]
	* Spirit of Wizard will now consume an item 7321 each time it blocks
	  reflected magic. [Skotlex]
	* Added script command jobname, retrieves a given's class name as per the
	  appropiate msg_athena.txt entry (this command should had been added years
	  ago) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed null-pointer crash on Evolving a homunculus. [Skotlex]
	* @produce now can make any kind of equipment [Skotlex]
	* Made HLIF_AVOID and HAMI_DEFENCE cause the status change on both caster
	  and target. [Skotlex]
	* AM_REST shouldn't be checking for a range now (since it's a self skill)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_ai so that mobs will use their rude-attacked skill when they
	  can't reach their current target. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the default txt config making pets be saved to the homun file
	  instead of to the pet file. [Skotlex]
	* Now arrow-consuming skills where your main weapon is a whip or musical
	  instrument WILL count as arrow-type attacks, using the atk of the arrow and
	  all related bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some homun timer initialization code. [Skotlex]
2006/08/15
	* Applied multiple fixes which should take care of making homun save/load
	  work on TXT now. [Skotlex]
	* Added Gatling Fever's batk bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning in status_damage which should prevent trying to free
	  already free'd pointers when unit_remove_map invokes unit_free (when
	  status_damage was going to invoke unit_free anyway) [Skotlex]
	* Delete homunc's skills from sql when the homunc is destroyed [Toms]
	* Homunc Timers should be disabled when the homunc is vaporized or dead an re-enabled on call/resu [Toms]
	* Updated vc-project files to compile with the new int_homun files.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed the crash when using charsave_method = 1 [Skotlex]
	* Moved s_pet structure from map_session_data to pet_data, this enabled the
	  removal of a few redundant values in the pet_data structure (name, class,
	  equip) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some of the pet related @/# commands, same for some script
	  commands. [Skotlex]
	* Pet offensive skills who's inf value is self will be casted on the pet
	  now (for stuff like Grand Cross) [Skotlex]
	* Added homun saving/loading support to char-TXT. Note that this is
	  completely untested, so it may be as good as broken. [Skotlex]
	* Added a crash-fix on status_calc_bl_sub_homun to abort in case the homun
	  has no master (need to clean up this function later) [Skotlex]
	* Tested char-txt load/save, it seems to be working fine, but you should
	  STILL backup, as I only launched the server (read old character format),
	  closed it down (saved into the new format) and relaunch it (read the new
	  format) and it didn't give problems (but there's still the possibility of
	  some field being read in the incorrect offset or such). [Skotlex]
	* Updated the char save structure for char-TXT servers so that the homun id
	  will be saved, now also the map info (last point, save point, memo maps)
	  are now saved using the mapindex rather than the string. BACKUP BEFORE
	  UPDATING since this code isn't yet tested. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the char-saving code, added overflow crash prevention in
	  case there are more memos than the max-allowed saved. [Skotlex]
	* AM_CALLHOMUN can now be used to recall vaporized homuns. [Skotlex]
	* AM_RESURRECTHOMUN will now fail when the homun is vaporized. [Skotlex]
	* Added SCB_DYE which marks which status-changes need a forced cloth dye
	  change to 0 due to sprite issues. Currently only NJ_BUNSINJYUTSU's status
	  uses it. [Skotlex]
	* Asura Strike now moves you to the target on fail always (unless the
	  target does not exists or is in another map or there's a obstacle on the
	  way) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected skill_attack_area hitting dead characters on it's splash range.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Swapped the values for OPTION_XMAS and OPTION_FLYING. This should enable
	  SG to show the fly animation again, even if sometimes others will see him
	  as Santa. As for xmas cloth, it shouldn't make much of a difference since
	  the view class is changed to christmas anyway. [Skotlex]
	* Made AM_CALLHOMUN and AM_RESURRECTHOMUN be like the wedding skills, where
	  they automatically pick a spot around you. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some the AM_RESURRECTHOMUN code. Hopefully it works now.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some the hom evolution code. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SIGSEGV with homunc save [Toms]
2006/08/14
	* Removed support for negative autosave intervals, instead added a
	  minsave_interval setting which specifies which is the minimum time between
	  character saves. Default to 100ms (map_athena.conf). [Skotlex]
	* Sacrifice no longer shows damage to self. [Skotlex]
	* When Asura fails, the skill display will still come off. [Skotlex]
	* Lots of cleaning of the Homun-code. Perhaps the crashes as of late will
	  be fixed now (reusing AM_CALLHOMUN seems to be the cause of them)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Increased Run's walk speed bonus to 25->50% [Skotlex]
	* Modified emergency_call setting to allow for more specific configuration
	  (woe/non-woe, gvg-grounds/non-gvg-grounds, disable from nowarpto maps), see
	  skill.conf for details. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed script engine allowing scripts to set a player's zeny to negative
	  values. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed setting hide_woe_damage making even "miss" attacks seem to connect.
	  [Skotlex]
	* When readjusting the fame-list, the last entry's id is also reset (may
	  fix characters appearing more than once on it?) [Skotlex]
2006/08/13
	* Removed @itemcheck as it was totally pointless. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected states killer/killable being easily dispellable. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the totally wrong text messages being used for @killer/@killable
	  related atcommands, added appropiate entries to msg_athena [Skotlex]
	* Magic and Misc attacks will now get type "flee" when they do less than 1
	  damage, this blocks them from causing additional status effects when they
	  are blocked. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the Basilica code, it should now properly end when you
	  walk. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some logs not working when you enabled all logs. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected unmute being a level 60 command by default (should be 80)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the mapif_parse_PartyChangeMap function to correctly update
	  level-range when someone logs on/off, fixes being unable to set even-share
	  on once it's been broken even when the characters out of range logoff.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/08/11
	* Fixed Kagebunshin no Jutsu crashing for dyes > 0; though this solution
	  might seem hackish (changing clothes colour to 0 when it starts while
	  storing original colour back in val4, restoring original dye upon
	  end), I believe this is the best way there currently is to solve
	  the issue. [blackhole89]
	* Fixed Dancers/Bards being able to use normal attacks while performing.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/08/10
	* Fixed the item group bonus not working. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed songs/dances always being considered overlapped with themselves.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added some additional song/dance overlap code that should correctly
	  change the effect of songs/dances when they overlap. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check so that the status-change packet is always send to self
	  when the inflicted char is a player disguised. [Skotlex]
	* Code cleanup on homunc, they stay in memory until player disconnect or 
	  homunc destruction [Toms]
	* Corrected Advanced Jobs HP bonus from 30% -> 25% [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed family-party-even-share not breaking when a member logs
	  out. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed the login-sql crash when passed user-name's length is
	  beyond the limit. [Skotlex]
	* Changed setting attack_attr_none to affect all neutral-element attacks.
	  Basicly, this setting is now used to determine who can hit for full damage
	  always when using neutral-attacks (defaults to non-players) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed two instances in the login-sql server where the ip in the log-login
	  table was being stored backwards. [Skotlex]
	* Now when a skill's range is 0 and the skill is NOT casted on self, it
	  will take the basic weapon's range (without Vulture/Snake Eye bonus).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Now when a duration is not specified, sc_start/sc_start2/sc_start4 will
	  try to guess the duration by extracting it from the skill_db (it uses
	  skill_get_time on whatever skill is associated to the status-change using
	  val1 as skill-level) [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups on trade_tradeaccept to prevent packets being resent when
	  they shouldn't. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed syntax error in 'guild' create table statement [Toms]
2006/08/09
	* Fixed Asura not wasting all SP away when it fails on cast-end. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed homunc skill up bug [Toms]
	* Adjusted some the dance/song/encore code so that the source of an
	  ensemble will always get checked, so that walking out of an ensemble skill
	  should make it end now. However, it's likely this is not completely solved
	  yet and will require further tweaking. [Skotlex]
	* Added crash protection to the mob_db txt reading when the mob_db file has
	  lines with insufficient number of columns. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the class-change code from battle_calc_weapon_attack to
	  skill_additional_effect. Alchemist summons now also have a chance of
	  triggering polymorphing. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the code which was auto-setting attacks that do no damage to type
	  FLEE, since that was disabling status-effects which should incur even when
	  the damage was blocked. [Skotlex]
	* Trade requests will now fail when either character is unable to act
	  (character in storage, vending, interacting with an npc, petrified, etc)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Heard skotlex voice, changed all msg_table[] into msg_txt() in atcommand.c [Toms]
2006/08/08
	* Fixed the char-server not invoking the party_calc_state function when the
	  third party-member is added to a party, hence failing to check for families
	  and disabling even share from them unless all three relog first (state is
	  correctly calculated when party is first loaded). [Skotlex]
	* Crash-protections in the mail-checking function. [Skotlex]
	* Some additional parenthesis on equipment check in pc_equipitem, seems to
	  have fixed the mid/lower headgear-sprites not showing up. [Skotlex]
	* Added back missing state set to prevent Ankle-Snare from being retrieved
	  after the target dies. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed compilation warning [Toms]
	* Added a check to handle Spider Web as a targetted skill. If there's more
	  than one character on the targetted cell, a different one may get trapped,
	  but it will mostly do as it is now. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to Asura so that it will move you to the target when it fails
	  ONLY when you can cast the skill on the target (not stunned, asleep, target
	  not hidden, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Changed the map_freeblock_unlock code so that when there's an "already
	  free'd pointer" error, the memory manager will print out the invoking
	  function rather than map_freeblock_unlock, this should help fix it up next
	  time it happens and is reported. [Skotlex]
	* Casting Kaensin will clear out Suiton and viceversa now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed drop-rates (@whodrops) getting duplicates when you use @reloadmobdb
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed unjailing not sending characters to Prontera. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed yet again AS_SPLASHER doing full damage on all characters. Now you
	  can use the NK split damage value in the skill_db if you want damage
	  divided by the amount of targets rather than by 2. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash on the battle_drain functions. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up HAMI_CASTLE, HLIF_AVOID, HAMI_DEFENCE so that it's usable by
	  other types of objects other than Homunculus. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the Asura Strike code so that the SP/Spheres/States is not
	  consumed when the skill fails due to Fog of Wall. [Skotlex]
	* When a negative delay for a skill is specified, this delay is now added
	  on top of the character's amotion rather than adelay [Skotlex]
	* Modified main.sql to make the guild table allow NULL on the emblem data.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added file conf-tmpl/Changelog.txt to log config changes. [Skotlex]
2006/08/07
	* Fixed the login-sql server replying to the change-sex packet with the
	  wrong gender, causing the char-server to screw-up job-change updates.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the apparent mess that is pc_skill. Hopefully it SHOULD work as
	  described on the docs now, this should also fix adopting not correctly
	  giving the family-related skills. The flag value of skill should be: 0 to
	  set the skill (if skill level is 0, this removes a learned skill), 1 grants
	  the skill as an item bonus which is temporary, and 2 will add a skill bonus
	  like 1, except the skill level adds up to whatever level already known of
	  that skill. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed EQP_WEAPON related code messing up with both weapon AND shield.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the Asura code so that when the skill fails your
	  SP/Spheres/Fury are all taken away always, as well as moving you next to
	  the target (as long as the target still exists within a reachable path from
	  your position) [Skotlex]
	* SC_GUILDAURA is now removed on logout. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Venom Splasher doing half-damage instead of full-damage to the
	  "exploding" character. [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed the party_even_share cast-overflow bug as reported by
	  Adobe. [Skotlex]
	* Standarized the autosave interval setting to be always in seconds
	  regardless of type. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the "bosses can't be knockback" logic from battle_calc_* functions
	  and placed it on skill_blown. [Skotlex]
	* Some parenthesis cleanup before invoking battle_calc_base_damage, could
	  be fixing the current issue with arrow attacks not adding the arrow damage.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the map_search_freecell error which was making mobs fail to
	  respawn. [Skotlex]
	* Added in Lupus's suggestion of not making multi-slot headgears set all
	  slot view-ids, which supposedly causes the client to re-draw the headgear
	  multiple times on characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed HT_BLITZBEAT hitting neutral characters when it auto-triggers.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Simplified the Tatami Gaeshi code. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed AS_SPLASHER doing full damage on everyone except targetted char
	  instead of the other way around. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed KAENSIN clearing out SUITON cells and viceversa. [Skotlex]
	* The spawn area is now seen as range rather than absolute for mob spawn
	  lines. This means that x,y,10,10 will spawn the mob on a 21x21 grid around
	  the given x,y point. [Skotlex]
	* Some clean up of the mob-spawn code. Now you can specify negative areas,
	  so that a spawn location such as 100,150,0,-1 will spawn a mob always on
	  x=100, but any Y value of the current map. [Skotlex]
	* Reflected damage will now also have a chance of draining hp/sp. [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted the order in which option/sc change packets are sent to match
	  Aegis's [Skotlex]
	* Added script command getpartyleader through which you can retrieve
	  various information of a party's leader. See doc/script_commands.txt for
	  further information. [Skotlex]
	* mpeg's Ninja work [Vicious]
	* Adjusted Battle_check_target so that alchemist summoned mobs are
	  targetted by everyone as long as 1. The top-level master is a player and 2.
	  the actual attacker is not a mob-type. [Skotlex]
	* Added config force_random_spawn which overrides the spawn-files defined
	  coordinates to make all mobs always spawn randomly on the map. [Skotlex]
	* SC_SPEEDUP0 is no longer dispellable by SA_DISPEL [Skotlex]
2006/08/06
	* Updated item_db.sql & mob_db.sql to latest. [Toms]
	* Little fixes on homunc (hp/sp are now saved and init stats changed) [Toms]
2006/08/04
	* Added a commented piece of code at the end of clif_parse_LoadEndAck which
	  will update your direction to wherever you were facing before warping.
	  Should this be the default? Nearby people DO see you facing on the same
	  direction before warping, it's only your client that will always see you
	  facing north on spawn (the spawn packet does contain direction
	  information). [Skotlex]
	* Updated @mobinfo to display slots in the drop information. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed flag.elefix not being respected in battle_calc_misc_damage.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some code cleanups in battle_calc_damage. [Skotlex]
	* Modified bAddItemHealRate so it can receive both item-id and item-group
	  values (since the first item-id is +500, there's no risk of mixing them
	  up). [Skotlex]
	* Removed settings enemy_critical_rate, homun_critical_rate. Added settings
	  enable_critical (defaults to specify only players), mob_critical_rate and
	  critical_rate. The last applies to all non-mobs and non-players
	  (battle/battle.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Removed settings mob_npc_warp, mob_warpportal. Replaced with setting
	  mob_warp which specifies which types of warp can a mob step into
	  (battle/monster.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Enabled Mastery damage on Soul Breaker again, moved adv katar mastery out
	  of the mastery function so that it may apply to all skills except Soul
	  Breaker. [Skotlex]
	* Changed name of the setting log_pick to log_filter since that's what it
	  does now. [Skotlex]
	* Modified enable_logs so that instead of a 0/1 setting, you can specify
	  which kind of events to log (so you can use a combination), see log_athena
	  for the bitmask configuration. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned a bit the contents of log_athena.conf
	* Hide/Chasewalk will again stop screaming skill name. [Skotlex]
	* Soul Breaker will no longer receive Mastery damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed warning:'type' might be used uninitialized in this function [Toms]
2006/08/03
	* Added a check to skip the experience share of characters who are dead or
	  on another map. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted the previous change, chasewalk has no icon, only the str-bonus
	  has that fist icon now. [Skotlex]
	* Allowed chase-walk to display a skill animation when using it. [Skotlex]
	* Readjusted the Chasewalk icon to be as it should be. [Skotlex]
	* GS_DESPERADO is now a short-range attack skill. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the Battle-Orders icon to be the Strength Up icon (for
	  Chasewalk's str bonus). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed using the right-hand weapon's size modifiers regardless of which
	  weapon's damage was being calculated in regards to. [Skotlex]
	* Simplified the ignore-size check by making the Weapon Perfection check be
	  done when specifying the flag, also moved the size-fix property of riding
	  spear-knights to status_calc_pc.  [Skotlex]
	* Changed SI_CHASEWALK value to 119 as concluded by LoneWolf [Skotlex]
	* Corrected clif.c sending the raw mdef2 value to the client instead of
	  first substracting the "secret vit/2" bonus from it. [Skotlex]
	* Added a damage cap to CR_ACIDDEMONSTRATION of INT_MAX/2 to prevent
	  overflows. It is not capped to INT_MAX because damage increasing skills
	  would cause it to still overflow afterwards. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed NPC_CRITICALSLASH not being considered as a Critical hit by the
	  code. [Skotlex]
	* Added RUDE_ATTACKED_COUNT so you can easily adjust how many rude-attacks
	  should happen before a mob uses the rude-attacked skill. Value has been set
	  to 2 for now. [Skotlex]
	* Now when a mob changes target (to someone they can hit) their
	  rude-attacked count won't be reset, but instead will be reduced by one.
	  [Skotlex]
	* SC_SPEEDUP0 can now stack with the other speed raising buffs. [Skotlex]
	* Some adjustments so that the last-skill-used will be correctly cleared
	  when your combo-time ends. [Skotlex]
	* Fix a bug in atcommand_charspeed [Toms]
	* Fixed a logic error preventing from cooking anything [DracoRPG]
	* Cleaned up the last NJ update code. [Skotlex]
	* Added @ command `charspeed` [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @jailfor using MAP_PRONTERA as jail instead of MAP_JAIL [Skotlex]
	* Removed case for GS_SPREADATTACK on damage packets to see if the skill
	  displays correctly now. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Deluge/Volcano/V. Gale overlaps so that the placing tiles are
	  removed, NOT the ones who were already placed. [Skotlex]
	* Made SC_SPEEDUP0 and SC_SPEEDUP1 use different icon IDs, to fix
	  icon-confusion when both are enabled at a time. [Skotlex]
	* Mob rude-attacked count is not reset now on picking a new char (gotta
	  investigate this further) [Skotlex]
	* Changed atoi to strtoul for guild-experience's field [Toms]
	* Fixed a bug in int_storage.c, temp array doesn't have the good size [Toms]
2006/08/02
	* Modified yet again SC_SILENCE after iRO tests from Entwined on IRC.
	  Silence now ONLY blocks skills from being used, it will not stop on-going
	  casts. [Skotlex]
	* Updated status_cast_cancel to also include silence (so the cast bar is
	  cancelled if you are silenced during it) [Skotlex]
	* Updated the way SC_SILENCE works. From what I remember (from previous
	  forum discussions) it: 1- Always blocks skills from being used. 2- Will
	  only block a skill when the cast-bar ends IF the skill is targetted. If
	  anyone wants to debate to get this changed, make an appropiate forum topic
	  in the svn development area to discuss. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check in the walking code when triggering skills.
	  NPC_SELFDESTRUCTION will no longer cancel walking, it will instead resend
	  the walk packet, this effectively causes the mob to start walking
	  (clientside) while the cast-bar is showing. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a logic error on battle_get_master which was causing infinite
	  loops.. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed homunculus error message [Toms]
	* Rewrote pc_payzeny to not use doubles, it may more accurately prevent
	  charging a player more zeny than they can withhold. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed failing to create Deadly Poison Bottles damaging 50% of your max
	  life instead of 25% [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing status-change flags to SC_FREEZE to signal it should
	  modify def and magic def [Skotlex]
	* Little add on NJ_HUUMA [Toms]
	* Merged Mpeg's work on Ninja skills [Toms]
	* Fixed Martyr's Reckoning having a cap damage of 32k. [Skotlex]
	* Now you can teleport in Thanatos Boss room, but you can't respawn there [Playtester]
	* Fixed Defender Raising Walk speed instead of diminishing it. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check on status-change load to prevent loading speed-affecting
	  status when their speed adjustment is 0 (prevents division by zero)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Code cleanup & optimization on guild part of char-server [Toms]
	* Fixed script code data not being free'd if a player quits in the middle
	  of a script. [Skotlex]
	* Modified run_script so that when there are leaks, it will report the
	  place where run_script was called from as source rather than the inner code
	  of run_script (for debugging purposes) [Skotlex]
	* Made recursive master check the default (otherwise it messes skill -> pet
	  -> player kind of herarchies) and cleaned up some the battle_get_master
	  code to prevent infinite loops in the weird case someone specifies that
	  their master is itself. [Skotlex]
	* Recoded the GuildAura code to use val3 & val4, allowing much greater stat
	  bonuses (in case someone wants to get Guild Skill level 20 or something
	  crazy like that) [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target so that all alchemist summoned mobs can be
	  target by everyone. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up skill_check_condition_mob_master_sub, it will now count both
	  total number of summoned mobs and amount that belong to the same type.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected AM_CANNIBALIZE so it will fail if you already have plants of
	  another type out. [Skotlex]
	* Using NPC_SELFDESTRUCTION no longer will make the caster stop walking.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed SI_GUILDAURA, and replaced it with SI_LANDENDOW, now
	  Volcano/Deluge/V. Gale will get that funky icon instead. [Skotlex]
	* Changed clif_hominfo to receive both sd and hd as parameters
	* Some redundancy cleaning in mercenary.c [Skotlex]
	* Moved updating of sd->mercenary.hp from merc_damage to pc_makesavestatus.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/08/01
	* Miscellanous fixes which make the Marine Sphere self destruction work as
	  best as I can. It only has one flaw: It self-destructs instantly after
	  walking because if I make it use self-destruction with a cast-bar,
	  client-side the object stops moving inmediately... [Skotlex]
	* Modified unit_walktoxy and NPC_RUN to enable running even when the caster
	  does not has the MD_CANMOVE bit on. [Skotlex]
	* PF_MINDBREAKER will now silently fail if you try to use it on someone who
	  already has the status active. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up yet again skill_landprotector, now new cells of
	  Deluge/Volcano/V.Gale will delete previous cells when they are recasted on
	  top of each other. [Skotlex]
	* Summoned Marine Spheres no longer get the MD_CANMOVE bit. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up some more the SC_JAILED code [Skotlex]
	* merged in atcommands jailfor, jailtime, charjailtime. Thanks to Meruru
	  and Coltaro for the code. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned the code of atcommands jail and unjail [Skotlex]
	* Be warned that the code MAY contain bugs as I adjusted it to save the
	  character's position before jailing, allowing the automatic unjailing to
	  warp you back to the exact spot you were at before being jailed. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed the cooking sets not displaying all cooking available
	  items. [Skotlex]
	* Figured out and fixed the issue with Volcano/Deluge/Violent Gale not
	  really working. Thanks to Mpeg for noting it out. [Skotlex]
	* Modified Self Destruction, so that Marine Spheres in non-versus maps will
	  hurt only enemies, while in all other situations this skill will hurt
	  everyone around them. [Skotlex]
	* Expanded setting debuff_on_logout so that &1 removes negative buffs and
	  &2 removes positive buffs. [Skotlex]
	* Food status boosts will no longer end on death, but they will end when
	  you respawn or logout. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config file status.conf, moved some settings from skill.conf
	  and battle.conf to it since they are entirely Status-Change related.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing lines to enable script command "kickwaitingroomall"
	  [Skotlex]
	* Magic Rod's can-act delay will no longer be applied when you absorb a
	  spell. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Don't Forget Me increasing speed instead of decreasing it. [Skotlex]
	* Modified setlabel so that the script engine barks when you are trying to
	  use the same label name as a constant or variable name. [Skotlex]
2006/07/31
	* Fixed the subnet 0 mask being reset to 0 when someone goes up on the fame
	  rankings. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Poison React chance to counter and number of counters as per
	  skill description updates. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Sharpshooting being counted as a magic attack, and hence, using
	  your MATK as base damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed NPC_STOP id value in skill_cast_db [Skotlex]
	* Bladestop will no longer stop when you push either of the characters
	  around. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Enchant Poison having a near 100% chance of poisoning target on
	  attack. [Skotlex]
	* Little fix on duel [Toms]
	* Added possibility to restrict duel usage to same map [Toms]
	* Merged mpeg's fix on ninja skills [Toms]
	* Corrected a status_get_race call which should be status_get_race2 in misc
	  attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the Devotion code to the top of the SC list in status_damage,
	  meaning that now stuff like being asleep or confused won't end if you are
	  hit, but the damage is absorbed by devotion. [Skotlex]
	* Added the Soul Link of Rogue speed bonus to Chase-Walk. Since there's no
	  information of how much the bonus should be, it currently is a conservative
	  10%. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible crash in the main script engine when restoring previous
	  script. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed sleep.tick not being set back to 0 before resuming execution, which
	  leads to scripts that are continously executed even when they already ended
	  (they do nothing but waste resources) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a pair of free -> aFree used on stacks, which would lead to memory
	  manager reporting leaks where there aren't. [Skotlex]
	* Removed incorrect "Waterball range+1 when standing on suiton" feature.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the Speed update code to prevent sending "walk to xy" packets
	  twice when the affected character is a player. [Skotlex]
	* Expanded mob can't move warning to print out where this mob was stuck at
	  (map, x,y) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed segmentation fault in status_change_end, vd wasn't initialized [Toms]
2006/07/30
	* NPC_INVISIBLE will now use Cloaking of a level +9 of the used skill
	  level, so that at level 1 they can attack, use skills and receive no
	  walking penalty. [Skotlex]
	* Mob casted Sanctuary will no longer always heal it's targets regardless
	  of element/race [Skotlex]
	* Status change packets will now use as criteria for sending the actual
	  view_class instead of player/not-player. This will fix status-changes
	  displaying improperly on clones, and also possible crashes with disguised
	  players. [Skotlex]
	* Merged mpeg's fix on ninja skills and SA_VOLCANO,SA_DELUGE,SA_VIOLENTGALE [Toms]
	* Added bNoMiscDamage setting so you can specify misc-damage blocking from
	  skills. Modified battle_calc_damage so that even Pressure and similar
	  skills will be affected by this setting. [Skotlex]
	* GS skill updates/fixes [Vicious]
	* Force all users offline in sql when char-server starts [Toms]
2006/07/29
	* Removed ugly struct cast in login.c [Toms]
	* New version of buildin_query_sql which accept more than one column and
	  can return the number of rows. See script_commands.txt for more details. [Toms]
	* Fixed nullpo in merc_hom_skillup [Toms]
	* Added a return value to buildin_rid2name if rid is invalid [Toms]
	* Made the SQL ping interval default to 7 hours. [Skotlex]
	* Made skill_unitsetting remove the group when no unit-cells were placed
	  down. basicly this means that if landprotector blocks all tiles, the group
	  will be removed from memory, preventing said group from counting to the
	  total number of skills you can set. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed segmentation fault in script engine when calling something which is not a function [Toms]
	* Fixed segmentation fault in script engine when activating DEBUG_RUN flag [Toms]
2006/07/28
	* Added Ishizu's code to check ammo type on attack. No more using Grenade
	  rounds with Guns. [Skotlex]
	* offensive heal/sanctuary will only happen when the source of the heal is
	  a player, mob/pet casted heal will now always heal regardless of target.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Shield Chain will now ignore the 'ice-pick' defense piercing bonus.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Self destruction will now hit all characters in range, not just enemies.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the NJ update code: [Skotlex]
	- Restored code which was removed (stuff like SC_SKA)
	- Fixed possible crashes on some NJ skills if used by non-players.
	- Fixed most NJ magic spells doing more damage than they should.
	- Fixed ZenyNage being able to do more damage than zeny you have.
	- Cleaned up skill setting code for Suiton and Kaensin
	* Some cleaning of battle_drain, Evil Druid card should work now. [Skotlex]
	* Made status_damage allow damaging of objects not on a map, this should
	  fix pet-catching making the mob never respawn again. [Skotlex]
	* Casted nothl to (unsigned int) in sprintf functions, IP is 32bits and sql field the same :) [Toms]
	* Fixed "warning: `list' might be used uninitialized in this function" in char/char.c@3032 [Toms]
	* Fixed "uninitialized local variable 'i' used" in skill.c and "warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'" in battle.c [Toms]
	* Fixed "warning: long unsigned int format, unsigned int arg" in parse_login (login_sql\login.c) [Toms]
	* Fixed sign warnings in login/login.c [Toms]
	* Fixed "conversion from 'double' to 'int', possible loss of data" [Toms]
	* Fixed "warning: redefinition of [ushort/uint/ulong]" [Toms]
	* Fixed duplicate case value on NJ_SUITON [Toms]
2006/07/27
	* Fixed a memory leak when there exists more than one user function with
	  the same name, added the appropiate warning when this happens. [Skotlex]
	* Added reporting source file when an npc shops item's price is
	  exploitable. [Skotlex]
	* The picklog will now record negative values for items sold to npcs.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added inmediate position and hp-bar update when a character joins a
	  party. [Skotlex]
	* Added missing SC information to NPC_CHANGEUNDEAD [Skotlex]
	* Added config setting party_update_interval so you can specify how often
	  the party-mate minidots should be updated (defaults to 1 sec). [Skotlex]
	* Removed a bunch of broken comments in skill.c [Skotlex]
	* Synced the script.c file with as much data as possible from jA's:
	  [Skotlex]
	- A lot of functions were moved around, a bunch of indentation and
	  space-usage changes were done to make it easier to diff against their
	  files.
	- Miscellanous addition and corrections were applied.
	- Largest one is likely a restructuring of run_script_main, which hopes to
	  solve the memory leaks.
	- script engine now uses the setjmp functions to restore memory state when
	  there's an error parsing scripts, which means that script errors won't
	  cause the map-server to inmediately bail out anymore.
	- NOTE that the amount of changes is pretty extensive, so DON'T USE THIS on
	  a live server. Update only to help test and debug to see if the script
	  engine memory leaks are gone.
	* Added a cleanup routine on shutdown to remove all characters from memory
	  for whom the save ack has not returned from the char-server yet. [Skotlex]
	* Now when you set the guardian's HP, if the guardian is spawned, it's HP
	  will be updated accordingly (and if you set it to 0, the guardian is
	  killed) [Skotlex]
	* Added functions status_set_hp/status_set_sp to set hp/sp to a given
	  value. Applied usage of these on the Berserk and Soul Change code.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added config setting "party_hp_mode" (battle/party.conf) which determines
	  method to use to update party-mate hp bars. Aegis style is to update HP
	  bars whenever HP changes, while eAthena style is to update it together with
	  the map party dots. Defaults to aegis style. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed packet 0x22a having the manner and opt3 packets in inverted
	  offsets. [Skotlex]
	* Readded the check which prevents Cloaking from activating when your
	  learned level is less than 3 and you aren't next to a wall. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups to the Frenzy/Berserk status change, it should probably
	  work correctly now. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a redeclared variable i in the parsing of the fame list (char-sql
	  server) which seems to be the cause of the random memory corruptions.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated item_db.sql to latest. [Toms]
	* Fix homunc & code cleanup [Toms] 
	  - Timer problems on delete_timer
	  - Intimacy problem (overflow & new values)
	  - Homunc deleted if intimacy < 0
	  - base exp is now given to master
	  - Homunc sometimes not saved
2006/07/26
	* Fixed a memory leak when reading the item_db txt. [Skotlex]
	* Applied the necessary changes to make @partyoption reflect it's changes
	  on the alt+p window. [Skotlex]
	* Modified party_item_share_type config setting so that using 1 disables
	  item-sharing from non-mob loot (player dropped items or pet loot) and 2
	  enables round-robin instead of random sharing. Using 3 obviously is
	  enabling both 1 and 2. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_get_master which returns the master bl of a given object.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Recoded battle_check_target to use battle_get_master, the src/target
	  switch has been split into two, so that actual target and master target are
	  seperately treated (same for source). [Skotlex]
	* Added support for "sc_end -1" which will clear all status changes. Added
	  the constant SC_ALL so you can use in scripts "sc_end SC_ALL;" instead.
	  [Skotlex]
	* @pettalk will now fail when muted. [Skotlex]
	* Enabled changing of equipment while stunned/asleep/petrified/etc [Skotlex]
2006/07/25
	* Cleaned up run_script_main to properly free previous stack-data when
	  running scripts. Note that scripts may still leak memory when run by
	  non-players and they don't reach the "END" state, however I am not sure how
	  this case should be handled, so it's left as it is for now. [Skotlex]
	* Added a missing ntohl call in the loginlog code. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check when buying from npcs to allow buying of item_avail items.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed duel accept invite sending the packet before the duel data is set
	  (resulting in a packet that noone receives). Thanks to Toms for finding it
	  out. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible crash when you dual-wield and the total damage is 0.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added Toms's perl scripts item_db.pl and mob_db.pl (they are in tools/),
	  they convert the txt databases into sql. [Skotlex]
	- Usage: "script" < "input file" > "output file". eg: ./tools/item_db.pl < db/item_db.txt > sql-files/item_db.sql
	* Updated the sql files since now it's quick [Skotlex]
2006/07/24
	* Re-updated the mob_db.sql to latest. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the skill_landprotector function to correctly block only magic
	  skills from being placed on land protectors. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected itemdb_group so that it will not return the random item givers
	  (should give priority to actual item groups, so that the item heal bonuses
	  work correctly) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the Mistress Card related code so that the no-gemstone bonus
	  reduces item requirements by one rather than totally skip them. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the logs "can log"function to use the IT constants. Also
	  corrected the "only log large amounts" setting not working on negative
	  values (trades). [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted skill_castfix_sc so that Suffragium will get consumed even on
	  instant cast skills, but Memorize won't. [Skotlex]
	* BladeStop will now end when either of the characters is moved (knocked
	  out?) around. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the Zeny penalty code from respawn to pc_dead. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to prevent Deluge/Volcano/Violent Gale from being placed on
	  top of each other. Reverted the previous 'fix' where atk was being
	  increased based on armor element rather than element of attack. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the noreturn mapflag check from script command warp. [Skotlex]
	* Homuculus cleanup [DracoRPG]
	  - Replaced nullpo's in parse functions by silent checks
	  - Removed server-side effect for menu option 0 (view status window...
	    why does the client send us the packet since we don't care? -_-)
	  - Rewrote intimacy underflow checks so they are really effective (no
	    need to check if an unsigned is < 0, it won't work... check before!)
	* fixed unban unblocking players as well. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Volcano/Deluge/Violent Gale increasing damage based on element of
	  attack instead of defense element of attacker. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the code of Magic Rod, fixed it not giving SP. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the code of Hermod and Basilica to castend_pos2 so it should work
	  now. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the code of Ankle Snare so the status ends on unit's time-limit
	  rather than when the snared object moves away. [Skotlex]
	* Re-worded the water check of ST_WATER skills. [Skotlex]
	* Allowed sc-cast reductions to be processed even when cast-time is instant
	  (to let suffragium end even on instant-cast skills) [Skotlex]
2006/07/23
	* Modified setting skillrange_by_weapon (skill.conf) to be a
	  per-object-type setting instead of yes/no. The default now is that
	  weapon-based skills will take the attacker's range for non-players.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of skillrange_by_distance to include homunculus.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed buildin_isequip not working correctly with non-cards. [Skotlex]
2006/07/22
	* Updated mob_db.sql to latest. [Skotlex]
	* Applied Toms's suggested corrections to homun code. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Cannibalize/Marine Sphere ignoring the selected summon spot.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed looting pets ignoring the item pick-up priority of other players.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed a signess warning in login txt. [Skotlex]
2006/07/21
	* Added blocking of @me when muted or in berserk status. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the @follow timer not being deleted on logout. [Skotlex]
	* Applied the homunculus code fixes provided by Toms. [Skotlex]
	* battle_check_target will now tag homunculus as invalid target when the
	  source is a skill-type object. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check on pc_equipitem so that when the client specifies to equip
	  a weapon on the right hand when the left hand is available, the weapon will
	  be sent to the left hand instead (when dual-wielding is possible,
	  obviously). Same for the left/right accessories. [Skotlex]
	* Added the necessary checks so that Suiton makes Fogwall have double
	  duration, and to make water-requiring skills to consume their cells.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the loadmap event description to specify that the mapflag
	  required is actually "loadevent", NOT "loadmap"! [Skotlex]
	* Now when the char-txt server does not finds a requested party, it will
	  clear out said party id of all characters (will help prevent massive
	  spamming/overhead when for some reason the party file needs to be deleted).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Combo skills (inf = self, inf2 = no target self) no longer check range if
	  you use them while your attack-timer is still active. [Skotlex]
	* Added back a map_freeblock call in skill_delunitgroup which caused a
	  memory leak when removed... [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to prevent Blind from ending while standing on a fog of
	  wall. [Skotlex]
	* The mob Slave ai will be executed now even when the slave has a target.
	  This will allow for "instant" warping to the master when it changes maps or
	  teleports. if the slave has a target already, it won't unlock it and chase
	  back to the master or anything like that. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a couple of checks that prevents item ids above 20000. However,
	  remember that the max id is still ~32k or the client is the one who's gonna
	  crash! [Skotlex]
2006/07/20
	* Added source reporting when you do an invalid int&str or str&int
	  operation on a script. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the intif party creation packet having the incorrect size sent,
	  hence causing the leader's level to be read as garbage (which caused the
	  "impossible to even share" bug). [Skotlex]
	* Added pc_check_weapontype to do a proper skill weapon check that takes
	  into account dual-wielding. That is, if a skill can be used with
	  daggers/axes, you'll be able to use the skill when dual-wielding them.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Cloaking level 1-2 not letting you move across walls. [Skotlex]
	* updated cloaking code so that when you set "enable cloaking without
	  walls", the code will consider you as "always next to a wall", thus you get
	  the wall-speed bonus always. [Skotlex]
	* Applied the fix to homunculus name saving... [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config settings agi_penalty_target and vit_penalty_target,
	  they define which object types will get vit/flee reductions when
	  multi-targetted and defaults to only players (battle/battle.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Added the dummy intravision case for the changeoption packet 0x229
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Fog of Wall so that all targetted offensive skills (not only
	  those who do damage) will fail on cast-end 75% of the time. [Skotlex]
	* corrected @homlevel up and one entry in the homun exp table as reported
	  on the forums by Albator. [Skotlex]
	* Added the SQL fix to Homunculus skill learning/saving bug [DracoRPG]
	* Added a status_check_skilluse on skill_attack_area call to prevent splash
	  damage skills from hitting hidden/trickdead/etc characters. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected fog of wall to behave as best known currently: [Skotlex]
	- Only takes effect when targetting a character inside it
	- -50hit/-75% damage when using normal-ranged attacks
	- -25% damage from all damage skills
	- 75% chance of all targetted damage skills of failing.
	* Should have fixed @refine applying multiple times to equipment that uses
	  multiple equip slots. [Skotlex]
2006/07/19
	* Fixed the inf code update breakage which was blocking all offensive
	  skills. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle setting homun_critical_rate (defaults to 0) [Skotlex]
	* Removed enemy_str/pet_str/enemy_perfect_flee and replaced them with
	  enable_perfect_flee which specifies which objects can have perfect flee and
	  enable_baseatk which specifies which objects can have a base attack value
	  (both in battle.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the targetted skill logic to enable offensive skills to be
	  targetted at party/guild members if the appropiate inf2 value is set.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added checks to make adding items to inventory/cart fail when a char is
	  in finalsave state. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed parse_names on irc.c crashing when receiving a null argument.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified the parsing of the names line, since some servers will send @
	  instead of = when separating the information. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the homun creation sql statement. Why noone else did so before?
	  [Skotlex]
	* When enabling/disabling hiding/unhiding an npc, if the npc is a warp, it
	  will use clearchar and spawn packets instead of changeoption. Thanks to
	  Toms for the fix. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Trim chars to block 'enter', as explained by the Ultra mage.
	  [Skotlex]
	* When the client passes account version 0, the login server will set it to
	  1 now. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the HP bar scaling when HP is above Short Max. It should
	  display fine for any HP value now. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check when the mob's adelay is shorter than the amotion, in which
	  case the adelay will be changed to the amotion value. [Skotlex]
	* Some minor mapflag changes. [MasterOfMuppets]
2006/07/18
	* Added atcommand @partyoption, lets you alter the party item-distribution
	  type on the go. Usage is "@partyoption <pickup share> <item distribution>",
	  where both arguments can be 0/1, yes/no, etc. [Skotlex]
	* Updated @changeleader and @partyoption to use msg_Athena entries.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added character 013 (enter) to the list of characters that are always
	  removed from new character names. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash when trying to extend TK's infinite combo feature. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Poison React to counter regardless of distance, and to use the
	  skill's 50+5*lv% counter chance (instead of 100%). [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Venom splasher's splash damage [Skotlex]
	* You now can't move/attack/use-skills when using Cloaking of a level less
	  than 3 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed compilation of mercenary.c [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Fog of Wall's "targetted spells fail 75% of the time" feature
	  by making it behave like GTB, that is, you just get a skill-failed on
	  cast-end, no skill-animation at all. [Skotlex]
	* Added a proper check to make aggressive mobs never override homun targets
	  regardless of distance. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a bunch of homun-related variables that are not needed at all.
	  The alive condition is removed, now the code checks for the hp value to
	  know if the homun is alive or not. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the skill-id function, homun skill checks (such as delay
	  and skill-lv learned) should be correct now. [Skotlex]
	* Added a proper check to make aggressive mobs never override homun targets
	  regardless of distance. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed giving the 100% damage bonus when no-splash-targets are found in
	  the blown path to Grandcross instead of Bowling Bash. Bowling Bash damage
	  equation becomes then +50*lv% rather than +40*lv% when there's no
	  splash-damage (the 50*lv% figure is custom, all we know is that level 10
	  does 600% instead of 500% damage). [Skotlex]
2006/07/17
	* Updated mob_db.sql to current mob_db.txt data. [Skotlex]
	* The char-server will allow off-line character saves when said char is
	  tagged for final-save (this is the scenario when the char-map reconnect).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed the Cart Termination damage code to be scaled correctly
	  when you change the max cart weight. Thanks to The Ultra Mage for the error
	  clarification. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Grandcross weird property where if there's noone on the path
	  it'll hit twice for the skill's reported damage, and when there is (or you
	  can't knockback the target) it'll do a splash attack that hits twice for
	  500% to all affected targets.  [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of the combo code. TK Rankers will now get their combo-time
	  extended each time they trigger a kick, enabling them to do "unlimited
	  combos". [Skotlex]
	* Modified the autosave function to use a sweep across the player db
	  instead of across connected clients. This will cause non-connected players
	  (like autotraders) to also be saved on a regular interval, may help with
	  possible data-loss from said characters on unclean shutdowns. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the code that forces aggressive mobs to go after a Homun instead
	  of their master (no reason why there should be such a condition). [Skotlex]
	* Some sign quest map flag updates [MasterOfMuppets]
	* atcommand_follow is now more verbose. [Adam]
	* Manually added int_homun.c to the VS8 char_sql project, *should* work [DracoRPG]
	* Orn's fix to the very critical skill level up bug [DracoRPG]
	* Updated mob_db.sql to current mob_db.txt data. [Skotlex]
	* Added Orn's lil fix on homun [Vicious]
	* Added Homunculus system, enjoy! [orn aka Nylou]
	  - WARNING: This currently only works with the SQL version, as the TXT char-server
	    has no code for it at the moment. You TXT server won't break, but the char-server
	    will complain of an unknown packet if you try to get an Homunculus
	* Updated nomemo mapflags based on info from http://ro.doddlercon.com/images/memo.jpg [Poki#3]

2006/07/15
	* Small change in conf/battle/player.conf to say that 199 is max aspd allowed
	  (Haplo says that there are many reports of having over 200 is giving errors) [Evera]
2006/07/13
	* Kaahi no longer shows the heal effect to everyone. [Skotlex]
	* Eska no will cause defense to change randomly every second. [Skotlex]
	* Tuned up some more NJ_KAENSIN based on Tharis's information. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected NJ_KAENSIN as per description. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a leaking map_freeblocklock on skill_del_unitgroup. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default save interval to 5 minutes. Added support for
	  specifying fixed save-intervals by using negative values. [Skotlex] EG:
	- Save interval set to 300 (5 minutes): all characters will be saved in
	  equal time-slots, so that everyone is saved every 5 minutes regardless of
	  number of players online. 
	- Save interval set to -1000 (1000 ms): One character will be saved every
	  second, regardless of amount of characters online.
	  The new fixed-time-slots method is meant for larger servers, so that they
	  can control the saving-induced stressed on the char-server.
	* Fixed @storeall and @charstoreall failing when the target character
	  already had the storage open. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted temporarily the Cart Termination equation until it can be
	  fixed... [Skotlex]
	* Fixed script command "recovery". [Skotlex]
2006/07/12
	* Fixed a small typo in my code [Zido]
	* Added negative value in bonus exploit fix for more stat bonuses [Zido]
	* Fixed exploit in pc_bonus there are no checks that check that the value being
	  added onto a status don't make it go below zero, which means if you have a mineral
	  card and reset stats it reduces your base attack to lower than zero, making it
	  go up to 64000. Fixed by adding a check for SP_BASE_ATK, although i recommend
	  doing it for other status bonuses also [Zido]
	* Recoded NJ_BAKUENRYU to behave as I understand it best from the
	  skill-description (since Haplo told me this skill doesn't really has video
	  information or anything...) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed NJ_TATAMIGAESHI to use ground-tiles rather than "for each in path"
	  calls. The skill should be working correctly now, except for the fact that
	  the correct "unit id" is missing (this is what would give the ground tile
	  it's correct display). Temporarily it is using 0xba until the correct value
	  is found. [Skotlex]
	* Added back the undead check to turn undead/resurrection to prevent
	  damaging non-undead targets, removed it from the battle damage section.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Resurrection will now silently fail when used on non-undead + not-dead
	  characters. [Skotlex]
	* Poem of bragi/magic String's base delay reduction at level 10 (or above)
	  is now 50% instead of 3*lv%. [Skotlex]
	* status_damage will no longer fail when the target is not on a map AND the
	  flag is 2 (charge rather than damage). Fixes SP-draining status changes
	  ending suddenly when in-between maps. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the IP value being apparently incorrectly casted before inserting
	  into the loginlog table on "connect success" events. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Cart Termination's damage. [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing check to remove character from memory when logging out
	  and using the charsave_method which saves character map-server-side.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/07/11
	* Fixed inverted check which was preventing you from buying more than 1
	  from any stackable item.... [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed the crash in intif gm message... [Skotlex]
	* Fixed GTB card only working while you had a status-change active.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed being unable to compound cards in armor. [Skotlex]
	* Made @monsterignore be an universal ignore. Means you cannot be targetted
	  as an enemy by anything. Also added alias "@battleignore" which does the
	  same as monsterignore. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed magic power setting your min matk as max-matk. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the packets involved in @fakename in hopes it'll refresh
	  correctly on nearby clients now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_parse not checking for func_parse before sending data to the
	  connected clients. This in turn required various code-rewrites in: [Skotlex]
	- duel related messaging functions (added clif targets DUEL/DUEL_WOS).
	- intif whisper to gm function
	- day/night timers
	- Rewrote the parse_console function to stop allocating/deallocating memory
	  on every call.
	- Modified chrif_charselectreq to receive the player's ip among the data.
	* Added function clif_disp_message, which is the same as
	  clif_disp_onlyself, except you can specify the targets (it sends a
	  guild-chat packet) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the subele bonus (elemental reduction) being applied to the element
	  of the attacker instead of the element of the attack. [Skotlex]
	* mob skills now won't trigger on unit_stopwalking calls. [Skotlex]
	* Coded @reset. [Skotlex]
	* Reenabled @changesex [Skotlex]
	* Added function pet_create_egg which handles creating pet eggs correctly
	  (when passed item id is indeed a valid petegg). Applied this on @createitem
	  and getitem. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up code of @item [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the itemdb_isequip functions. itemdb_isequip will now return
	  if the item is equipable by players, itemdb_isstackable returns if the item
	  can be stacked, and itemdb_isidentified returns if the item should drop
	  identified. [Skotlex]
	* Added defines CARD0_PET/CARD0_FORGE/CARD0_CREATED to identify if a given
	  item has "invalid" cards, added define function itemdb_isspecial to
	  simplify this check. [Skotlex]
	* Removed itemdb.c considering item ids above 20000 as invalid. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up script commands getitem and card-counting related ones.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit more pc_isequip [Skotlex]
	* Added script function warpportal(x,y,targetmap$,targetx,targety).
	  This creates warp portals as in the skill unit as a volatile alternative
	  to static warp portals. [blackhole89]
	* Modified the login-sql server to do the ip-ban check only on the
	  auth-packets instead of on every packet. [Skotlex]
2006/07/10
	* Corrected Warp Portal being unable to warp people who are standing on it
	  on the moment it triggers. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @follow stopping the moment you are warped. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_additem messing with the equip field of the passed item data.
	  Fixes the famous "equip stuff on your arrow slot" bug. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cart-termination crashing the server if you used level 16 of it.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed check_connect_login_server check in char-sql server. Fixes
	  char-server not reconnecting to the login server. [Skotlex]
	* Login-sql server will no longer change an account's state to "7" when
	  banning a player. This should fix being able to use @ban to clear out a
	  @blocked player. Players will now be identified as banned only through the
	  banned-until timestamp. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash when using Gospel... [Skotlex]
	* The on-place function won't be invoked on setting ground skills if the
	  group's tick is greater than the current tick. As Buuyo pointed out, this
	  should fix Sanctuary and Gospel taking effect inmediately instead of after
	  "x" amount of ms as they should. [Skotlex]
	* Added login-char packet 0x2737. Sets all characters offline (login-server
	  side). [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up char server "set all offline" implementation to remove only
	  characters from the map-server from which the packet was invoked. It will
	  also now correctly kick/set-character offline from the map-server if they
	  are connected. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the char-sql reconnect code. It no longer sets everyone to
	  offline. [Skotlex]
	* Removed setting "kick_on_disconnect", servers will no longer kick
	  characters out when there's a disconnection. Instead, it'll use the most
	  logical approach: Set characters into a "lost" state when there's a
	  disconnection, on reconnect, resent the list of online-characters, do a
	  sync, and let the difference be characters to be removed. Also, the
	  map-server won't release character data until it's saved and the ack
	  returns from the char-server to prevent data loss (all this data is resent
	  on reconnect for saving anyway). [Skotlex]
	* Added a check in pc_equipitem so that when switching weapons and you have
	  the skill_range_by_weapon setting active, the skill info block (which
	  includes range) will be resent when the new weapon to equip has a range
	  different than the previous one. [Skotlex]
	* One closer inspection, removed that clear in itemdb_reload for a foreach
	  call again. And modified itemdb_load to scrap the dummy item entry from the
	  item_db and replace it with proper data for the item. [Skotlex]
	* itemdb_reload will clear the itemdb before reloading info instead of only
	  clearing the scripts now. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of skill_castend_pos2, fixed Gospel, and a
	  map_freeblock_unlock misplacement. [Skotlex]
	* Sense/Estimation will now display the mob info window to all party
	  members in the same map. [Skotlex]
2006/07/08
	* Fixed the new addeff structure not working well with SC_STONE (because
	  SC_STONE is 0, which was by default not handled as a valid value).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added back the TF_MISS walking speed bonus to assassin type classes (how
	  did that got lost?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobinfo displaying exp as signed ints rather than unsigned.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added status_check_visibility to check if an object is within range of
	  view of another. Nothing more, nothing less. It's used by unit movement to
	  check whether you can continue chasing your target or not when the "chase
	  target" directive is given. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the char table having party/guild_id as smallint when they need int
	  there. Thanks to hermematon for pointing it out (use svn_ugprade7580.sql)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied k3dt fixes to pet-hatching, ice-wall check, and wedding skills.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed endow skills calling the skill no damage packet twice. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash on warpwaitingpc when the chat-room is empty. [Skotlex]
2006/07/07
	* Fixed the Warm Skills [Skotlex]
	* Removed the debug message when a player logs out and is removed from
	  memory, it is working fine (tested normal logging off and autotrade). [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the pet-armor field of the pet not being updated on
	  equip/unequip of accessories, making them not show up inmediately. [Skotlex]
	* Status_calc_bl will no longer stop you from attacking/walking when the
	  mode is changed unless the new mode no longer includes
	  "can-attack"/"can-move" respectively. [Skotlex]
	* Should have fixed clif_item_sub to properly store pet egg/armor data.
	  There should be no more "random refine levels" bugs related to these.
	  [Skotlex]
	* itemdb_exists will now return NULL for item_id 0. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to free a character from memory when changing map servers.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Okay, added a chrif_save_ack packet to the char-server so now the map
	  server will know once a character was "final saved", and only then the
	  character will be removed from memory. On char-server reconnection, all
	  chars that are in final-save state are resent to save (if they are still in
	  memory, it's because the ack hasn't gotten here from the char-server). This
	  should effectively block all dupe problems due to heavy inter-server lag,
	  however as it's untested, it currently prints some debug messages when
	  people are saved and then removed from memory. Need testers so this can be
	  debugged and merged to stable! [Skotlex]
	* Now, when the login-char connection is cut, the char-server won't set
	  everyone offline on reconnect, instead it will send the list of online
	  accounts to the login server. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the error on the char-sql server to set chars online when it
	  receives a save packet from a character tagged as offline (until it can be
	  figured out why this is happening) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed signed/unsigned comparison issues in the char txt/sql server.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the cooking success chances. Thanks to Ishizu Chan. [Skotlex]
	* Added a temporary band-aid to prevent executing the script of non-arrows
	  when they are equipped on the arrow-slot (until the actual cause of why
	  pc_unequipitem is not working correctly is discovered/fixed) [Skotlex]
2006/07/06
	* Modified the party_data structure on the map server to remove some
	  redundant data. Added a party_data structure on the char-server to hold a
	  more complete set of information about parties. Added to the party_member
	  structure the class of each member so that the map server can do the
	  appropiate checks even if the character is on another mapserver/offline.
	  Due to the format changes in the party structure, txt servers will have to
	  wipe their party file... (sql save format has not been changed) [Skotlex]
	* Added function char_family to check if there's a family state given the
	  three character ids, instead of doing individual checks all the time.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote all the item restriction functions so that they will take into
	  account slotted card restrictions as well. [Skotlex]
	* Added no_skill_delay setting, when set, affected object types will have
	  the minimum skill delay for all skills. Defaults to mobs, since they
	  don't have skill delays. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up pc_equipitem. When dual wielding or equipping accessories, if
	  the client actually specifies one of the two positions, it will be taken
	  into account (now, does the client actually does this?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed GrandCross and similar skills. [Skotlex]
	* FogWall will now also affect the caster. [Skotlex]
2006/07/05
	* Updated NJ_KAENSIN by Saycyber21 [Vicious]
	* Updated  @refine to take account of MAX_REFINE, thanks to Omega... GM
	  Designer. [Skotlex]
	- Also optimized the @refine loop for better performance.
2006/07/04
	* Fixed compile issue for NJ_BAKUENRYU, by Saycyber21. [Vicious]
	* Implemented Saycyber21's some NJ work. Untested. :D [Vicious]
	* Implemented cooking chances. Chance of success is 70% - 7*(dish-lv)% +
	  12*(cooking set-lv)%. Exception: When using the legendary cooking set,
	  success chance is 100% regardless of dish. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config setting emergency_recall, specifies behaviour of that
	  skill (skill.conf): 0 - Disabled. 1 - can't be used in nowarpto maps. 2 -
	  Can be used everywhere. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the NPC/Dance/Song inf2 check of AbraCadabra. whether a skill can
	  come out or not is entirely decided by the abra db file now. [Skotlex]
	* Added structure s_addeffect to handle status change additions. Cleaned up
	  relevant code. It is now possible to specify ANY status change, not just
	  the basic ones. NOTE that the code is proof-read, but untested! [Skotlex]
	* Added support for bonus3 bAddEff/bAddEffWhenHit as follows: [Skotlex]
	  bonus3 bAddEff/bAddEffWhenHit, <SC value>, <rate>, <target flag>.
	  Target flag is 0: Self. 1: Enemy. 2: Both.
	* Added these descriptions to doc/item_bonus.txt [Skotlex]
	* Added a check when joining a chat to make sure the target object is of
	  type BL_CHAT. [Skotlex]
2006/07/03
	* Cleared up the bAutoSpellWhenHit description in doc/item_bonus.txt
	  [Skotelx]
	* Fixed Phantasmic Arrow and Magical Bullet not being correctly tagged as a
	  ranged arrow-type attack. [Skotlex]
	* Updated help.txt and help2.txt, thanks to Inuyasha for providing the
	  updated files. [Skotlex]
	* Char-server SQL won't perform the reconnect cleanup routines when
	  kick_on_disconnect is disabled. [Skotlex]
	* Renamed summons_inherit_effects to summons_trigger_autospells as the
	  setting now only makes the attacks of the slaves trigger the autospells of
	  the master (as it should be). [Skotlex]
	* Corrected code capping no_spawn_on_player to 50 when the max should be
	  100. [Skotlex]
	* Warmth will dispel when warping now (or else the effect is left on the
	  ground) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed reading of the refine_db not working right when MAX_REFINE is
	  increased from 10. [Skotlex]
	* Some more cleaning to the implementation of Abracadabra [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a compile warning in login sql/txt [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_makesavestatus not setting your logout position. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed two dances becoming BA_DISSONANCE instead of DC_UGLYDANCE.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing +100% damage modifier of Enchant Deadly Poison.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SkillStatusChangeTable not working correctly for Homun/Guild
	  skills. [Skotlex]
2006/06/30
	* Fixed a typo in msg_athena.conf, "This item cannot be drop" -> "This item cannot be dropped" [MasterOfMuppets]
	* Added a check to prevent equipped items from being traded. [Skotlex]
	* Added UF_SONG (0x400) to differentiate songs from dances. [Skotlex]
	* Added preliminar support for making a Song+Dance turn into BA_DISSONANCE
	  cells. Beware of potential bugs as it's untested. [Skotlex]
	* Added mapflag "nochat" to prevent chatting rooms from being created.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected some of the sleep checks when the char id does not matches with
	  the char-id expected by the script engine. [Skotlex]
	* Cleanup in itemheal related code, fixed the item heal group bonus not
	  working on Groups beyond 7. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pet's loot not being moved to your inventory on logout. [Skotlex]
2006/06/29
	* Made the map server send list of characters online to the char-server on
	  reconnection regardless of "kick_on_disconnect" setting, as otherwise, a
	  temporary disconnection would make the char-server tag all characters
	  offline and refuse to save them afterwards. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed guild storage being "eternally in use" if you quit/logout before
	  closing it. [Skotlex]
	* Ending SC_CLOAK/SC_HIDE/SC_CHASEWALK will now trigger ontouch npcs.
	  [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]
	  - Scripting system screwing up script position after mixing timers with menus.
	  - NPC attached AI mobs display as alive when dead.
	  - View data not updating after buildin_unitdeadsit.
	  [Improved]
	  - NPCE_LOADMAP to execute after all (area) objects are sent to the player.
	  - Simplified scripting system. sd will now use pointer to the script state itself.
	    [Lance]

2006/06/28
	* changed:
	  dynamic_pass_failure_ban_how_many:from 3 to 7
	  dynamic_pass_failure_ban_how_long:from 60 to 5
	  as in official servers. [Musashiden]
	* Added a check in script command "set_option" so that invoking
	  "set_option(0)" removes Cart/Peco/Falcon, as expected by scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Added trade-range check on trade start. [Skotlex]
	* Added inf2 4096 (INF2_ALLOW_ENEMY) which is to be used in conjunction
	  with INF2_PARTY_ONLY/INF2_GUILD_ONLY when said skill should ALSO be allowed
	  to be used on enemies. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the code for @item [Skotlex]
	* Fixed character/storage being sent to be saved TWICE when you logged out
	  while the storage is opened. [Skotlex]
	* Added save_settings map config. Specifies after which events do
	  characters get saved (defaults to all): 1 - Trade successful, 2 - Vending
	  transaction, 4 - Closing storage/guild storage, 8 - hatching a pet.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Changed the mob drop rate adjust function to receive a signed int
	  argument. Probably will fix those drops with 0% becoming 100% [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Musical Strike having a different damage equation from Throw
	  Arrow. [Skotlex]
	* Added state rewarp to players. It gets set when a pc_setpos call is
	  triggered while the player is changing maps so that when the player finish
	  loading the map, it is inmediately rewarped to where it has been
	  rewarped/recalled to. [Skotlex]
2006/06/27
	* Map server will now resent the whole list of online characters to
	  char-server on reconnect when the kick_on_disconnect setting is active.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and optimized the IP sync code. New login_athena config
	  setting sync_ip_interval specifies how often to sync the ip. The default is
	  0 (disabled). [Skotlex]
	* Added mapflag "loadevent", now load-map script events will ONLY trigger
	  on maps with this mapflag on, rather than every map. [Skotlex]
	* High Jump can now be used in all versus maps. [Skotlex]
	* Added Kaite's opt3 value, taken from jA [Skotlex]
	* Added state dirty == 2 to storages. Signals when a storage was sent for
	  final saving. Said storage is removed from memory after the ack from the
	  char-server, and they are sent to save if the map/char servers reconnect
	  before the ack arrives. In short: they are guaranteed to be saved after a
	  char logs out. [Skotlex]
	* Put pay_arche.gat in the "no experience lost" mapflag file. [MasterOfMuppets]
2006/06/26
	* Corrected the element of hunter traps. [Skotlex]
	* Deadly Poison now also reduces def2 by 25% [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit skill_moonlit, Moonlit Petals should work correctly now.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @mi displaying always 0 instead of the mob's class. [Skotlex]
	* Rough implementation of Ground Drift according to description and jA
	  info. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Tatami Gaeshi using skill description and jA implementation
	  for reference. [Skotlex]
	* Merged Mitternacht's max_heal/max_heal_lv config settings. [Skotlex]
	* Removed support of packet 0xc3 on the new packet versions. Thanks to
	  Meruru for pointing out they aren't being used anymore. [Skotlex]
	* Autospells will now again check for the skill's nk value, so that skills
	  tagged "nodamage" skills will not trigger autospells. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected clif_item_sub so that pet eggs will correctly be sent as
	  equipment (fixes them showing up "broken" and with random refine levels)
	  [Skotlex]
	* [Added]:
	  - buildin_unitkill just for kicks. [Lance]

2006/06/23
	* [Optimized]:
	  - Setting of variables with defined scope in some frequently executed script
	    events.
	  [Added]:
	  - Missing script_require_trigger flags for some power hungry events.
	* Updated mob_db.sql and item_db.sql to latest. [Skotlex]
	* Modified pc_setoption so that it will correctly update sprite AND clothes
	  color when mounting/unmounting changing into/from xmas/wedding sprites.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Allowed itemdb_exists to return the dummy item. Enables "invalid" items
	  to be sold, traded, dropped, etc. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected ASC_BREAKER. Int-based damage is applied after attribute fixes
	  and before card reductions. The skill now completely disregards left
	  hand weapon. [Skotlex]
	* Standarized PF_MEMORIZE to be 50% cast time on all skills (instead of
	  -50% for targetted skills and -66% for ground skills >.>) [Skotlex]
	* Cleared up the comment on what item_check does and how it works.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Changed setting for skill_nocast flag 16. It is no longer a "pk-mode map"
	  setting, it's now a clone-forbidden skill. That is, skills with the flag 16
	  will never be copied by clones. If you use a PK-mode server, use flag 2 now
	  to forbid skills from common maps. [Skotlex]
	* Default skills from not being cloned are Magnus Exorcism and Turn Undead. 
	* The map search free cell will now use the size of the map # of tries
	  before giving up when the spawn area is the whole map. Added a check to
	  inmediately give up when the number of spawn retries has reached the max
	  specified (no_spawn_onplayer = 100). [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up a bit the clone code to account for the unit flags
	  UF_NOPC/UF_NOMOB when the skill is not ground-based (accounts for self
	  skill that causes a ground-tile to be placed, like Dances). [Skotlex]
	* Added pc_bonus_autospell_del, gives support for removing autospell
	  effects. When a negative rate is specified, it will decrease the chance of
	  casting (eg: You have two different cards with autospell Heal +20% each,
	  then do autospell -30. The second card will be cancelled, and the first one
	  will become Heal +10%) [Skotlex]
	* npc_timers now will not restore the previous timer data when there's no
	  players attached (when it's strictly an npc timer). This should reenable
	  the old behaviour of getnpctimer returning the total ellapsed time since
	  "startnpctimer" even after the last label has been reached. However, this
	  behaviour won't apply to player-attached timers.  [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - MAPREGSQL overloading SQL table with temperory map registries.
	  - Incorrect perfomance calculation for MAPREGSQL loading and saving. [Lance]

2006/06/22
	* Guessed and added support for the packets 0x22a (idle) and 0x22b (spawn).
	  This should complete the required packets for PACKETVER 7. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for the PACKETVER 7 packets in the "dummy" current
	  intravision implementation. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @autoloot being off by 0.01% when entering a manual value.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Restored the "Secret" behaviour of Blast Mine and Claymore Trap where
	  each target is hit N times (where N is the number of mobs in the splash
	  area at the moment of triggering). [Skotlex]
	* Updated the tools/stackdump script to also handle sig-plugin generated
	  backtraces. Now it will also auto-determine whether the exe needs a .exe at
	  the end or not. Help me test it as I want this script on stable NOW :X
	  [Skotlex]
	* Usage is "stackdump <login/char/map> <txt/sql> [number]". When a number
	  is given, sig-plugin stackdumps are assumed, otherwise it parses the normal
	  stackdump as before. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected autoloot so that you can specify rate with decimal precision
	  ("@autoloot 0.01" should work) [Skotlex]
2006/06/21
	* [Removed]:
	  - Redundant mob name copying. (it's already copied in mob_parse_dataset) [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Compilation warnings and errors.
	  [Improved]:
	  - Changed and moved IP sync status messages to elaborate more. [Lance]
	* Tested and fixed resolve_hostbyname. Applied said function around most of
	  the code where needed. Removed includes for the OS/network system pretty
	  much from every file (our socket.c file should handle this) [Skotlex]
	* Made the GM mute request bypass the manner_system setting. [Skotlex]
	* Applied use of parse_hostbyname() in chrif.c to fix compilation errors.
	  [Skotlex]
	* status_percent_change will now account for when the target's max hp/sp is
	  above INT_MAX. [Skotlex]
	* [Added]:
	  - DNS (WAN) sync for those pesky disconnections (dynamic ip renewal). [Lance]
2006/06/20
	* Some cleaning up of OPTION related code. OPTION_XMAS and OPTION_FLYING
	  really ARE the same value clientside! (totally stupid), therefore I've
	  opted from removing the flying animation since it really just displays as
	  Xmas for others (and the correct fix involves adding a bunch of
	  class-change packets...) [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill_require_db to place the Zeny requirements of ZenyNage and
	  Fling. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when non-players use ZenyNage. Added the correct Zeny check
	  in skill_check_condition, fixed the skill so that it's damage is based on
	  whatever zeny is specified in skill_require_db. [Skotlex]
	* Can-act delay will not be reset when warping now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Quagmire not altering walking-speed. [Skotlex]
	* Silence now blocks skills both on begin/end casting. [Skotlex]
	* Updated status_calc_bl so that when walking speed changes, the character
	  is made to rewalk so that the new speed takes effect inmediately. [Skotlex]
2006/06/19
	* Added Ayothaya to nopenalty and nopvp mapflags. [Evera]
	* Combo-used Skills with State "move_enable" will now override the "can't
	  move delay". Fixes Break-Fall -> Jump-Kick. [Skotlex]
	* Some more cleanups of battle_calc_damage to account for absorbed damage
	  reductions. [Skotlex]
	* Moved back Soul Drain code from mob_dead to skill_counter_additional_effect.
	  Now we are back to where the skill animation does not shows, but you DO
	  get SP T.T' [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups and corrections in battle.c to account for negative
	  (absorbed) damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed fame-list updating crashing char-sql server when the given char-id
	  just got into ranking. [Skotlex]
	* Added missing Arunafeltz maps with information from NLZ [Evera]
2006/06/18
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Typo in status.c add_sc() using 'skill' instead of 'sk' as index, resulting in
	    filling the SkillStatusChangeTableArray with junk data.
	  - > NEEDS CONFIRMATION < Ends casting if player is knocked with freezing/stun/whatever
	  - Typo in parse_frommap. [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - clif_initialstatus using SHRT_MAX instead of USHRT_MAX for status_point.
	* [Temperory Fixed]:
	  - Crashing of SQL char-server in parse_frommap case 0x2b01. [Lance]
	* [Removed]:
	  - Large part of scripted mob control commands are removed.
	  - Large part of scripted player control commands are removed.
	  - Scripted mob slaves changing master ID.
	  [Added]:
	  - Unit control commands.
	  - CALLBACK_NPCCLICK for scripted mobs, added this to db/const.txt too.
	  - Macro RECURSIVE_MASTER_CHECK in battle.c
	  [Modified]:
	  - buildin_skilluseid and buildin_skillusepos -> buildin_unitskilluseid
	    and buildin_unitskillusepos.
	  - md->callback_flag to short (double word).	[Lance]

2006/06/17
	* Devotion absorbed damage will now appear to come from oneself (instead of
	  the original attacker changing directions towards the Crusader) [Skotlex]
	* Updated clif_refres to send inventory, cart, and weight info. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed intif_guild_memberinfoshort to not leave a dangling pointer when
	  someone logs out <.< [Skotlex]
	* Changed some mapflags related to the eye of hellion quest. [MasterOfMuppets]
	* [Added]:
	  - buildin_checkcell, buildin_mobwarp, buildin_pcattack.
	  [Improved]:
	  - buildin_skilluseid and buildin_skillusepos to accept a few more arguments.
	  - mob_script_callback to return sucess value [Lance]
	* Fixed the party HP packets to send max HP 10000 and scale HP accordingly
	  when the player's HP doesn't fits in the packet's field. Fixes HP bars not
	  correctly displaying the % of life when max HP is above 32k. [Skotlex]

2006/06/16
	* Fixed option value being reset'ed on login (fixes cart/peco/falcon being
	  lost) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected @speed to alter your base speed instead of battle one. Means
	  the change remains for much longer (until status_calc_pc is invoked, which
	  could be due to equipping/unequipping stuff) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the bNoMagicDamage/bNoWeaponDamage bonuses to be a 0-100
	  setting. Meaning you can do bonus bNoMagicDamage,50; To make all magic
	  damage be reduced by half. This bonus stack, so two cards with
	  bNoMagicDamage,50 will give magic immunity. [Skotlex]
	* Removed setting gtb_pvp_only and replaced it with gtb_sc_immunity which
	  specifies the threshold before the bNoMagicDamage starts blocking support
	  statuses as well. ie: gtb_sc_imunity: 75 will mean that "bonus
	  bNoMagicDamage,70;" reduces magic damage by 70%, but does not blocks heal
	  or support status, while "bonus bNoMagicDamage,80;" does. [Skotlex]
	* Removed db_tables.sql as it's no longer used. [Skotlex]
	* the mvp_sd is removed when the mob is the emperium and there's no
	  killer/exp-awarded (assumed killed by script), this prevents the on-kill
	  event from triggering and giving the castle to whoever damaged the most the
	  emperium without destroying it. [Skotlex]
	* [Added]:
	  - Custom slave mobs to inherit the callback_flag.
	  - Added option #25 to buildin_setmobdata to set the callback_flag. [Lance]
	* [Improved]:
	  - Cleaned up Custom Mob Script Callback codes. Looks much better now :B. [Lance]

2006/06/15
	* [Fixed]:
	  - intif_parse_RenamePetOk for not compatible with ANSI-C initialzation specification.
	    [Lance]
	* Added indexes for loginlog and ipbanlist as they did not have any. 
   	  (note, someone already put the index on loginlog on trunk.) [Euph]
	* Merged Adam's patch to let the char-server handle validation of
	  pet-name-change requests through the allowed char letters config. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "wedding_ignore_palette: yes" not working when relogging with the
	  gear already equipped. [Skotlex]
	* Added blocking of the Kick skills when you are a Soul Linker. [Skotlex]
	* Added enabling to turn off a kick-stance regardless of class. [Skotlex]
	* Altered a bit how status_set_viewdata behaves in regards to Wedding/Xmas
	  options. [Skotlex]
	* Added back OPTION_XMAS, but the actual value is missing! [Skotlex]
	* Corrected chrif_save so that the player is not set offline on map-change.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added change-look support in pc_setoption when specifying OPTION_XMAS
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_parse_RemoveOption removing all options instead of just
	  Falcon/Cart/Peco [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_send not sending packets to SELF when specifying AREA if the
	  source is not on the map yet. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed and cleaned up script command 'equip' [Skotlex]
	* Fixed 'autoequip' items. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Aspd not being updated in your status window after Agi/Dex
	  increasing statuses take effect. [Skotlex]
2006/06/14
	* Fixed map_nick2sd so that searching for "Adam" will not match a char
	  named "Adam Smith". Thanks to Adam for reporting it out. [Skotlex]
	* Modified how luk reduces status changes by reducing the gap. Eg: resist =
	  vit; resist += (max - resist)*luk/300; [Skotlex]
	* Added battle settings pc_max_sc_luk/mob_max_sc_luk to handle which is the
	  luk threshold at which you gain inmunity (defaults to 300). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed buildin_getmobdata. It was trying to handle the first parameter as the
	  array to fill in. [blackhole89]
	* Blocked again skill usage during marionette. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed main.sql adding a key on char_id rather than account_id for the
	  char table. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up character saving in char-sql, it no longer needs to query the
	  database to see if the player exists on each char-save, instead it checks
	  the received data against the online-players db.  No such fix is required
	  for char-txt. [Skotlex]
	* Added an error message on the char-server when the received player data
	  size does not matches with the expected size (should avoid the crash that
	  happens on such a memcpy). [Skotlex]
	* [Improved]:
	  - script_save_mapreg for MapregSQL Saving to display perfomance only in slow
	    queries. [Lance]
2006/06/13
	* Updated mob_db.sql and item_db.sql to latest. [Skotlex]
	* Added account_id index to char table. Thanks to Buuyo for reporting it.
	  Sql users apply upgrade_svn7146.sql NOW. [Skotlex]
	* Marionette and Devotion will now check raw distance and ignore obstacles
	  and the like. [Skotlex]
	* Added irc_channel_pass setting and prevent crashing when irc server
	  lookup by host fails. Thanks to Trancid for the details. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - clif_parse_GetCharNameRequest displaying false alarm for legitimate GM snooping.
	    [Lance]
	* Added support for reading correctly status change data from Guild and
	  Homun skills. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for reading Homun skill data (which means the HM skills are
	  now safe to add to skill_db, skill_require_db, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Oppositions can't be made during WoE now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a few compiler warnings from VC [Skotlex]
	* Commented out the Homunculus Skills<->Status Change link which was
	  causing some memory corruptions. [Skotlex]
2006/06/12
	* [Fixed]:
	  - buildin_npcshopitem not allocating extra 1 block of terminator.
	  [Added]:
	  - Modified versions of Dj-Yhn's buildin_npcshopdelitem and buildin_npcshopadditem
	  [Lance]
	* Updated clif_disp_onlyself to not use dynamic memory and write directly
	  to the player's buffer. [Skotlex]
	* Updated @noask to also tell the user what he has just rejected (added
	  msg_athena entries for each of the different requests). Also updated it to
	  use clif_disp_onlyself. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a pair of missing initializers in the clif storage functions.
	  [Skotlex]
	* @heal no longer displays a healing animation. Fixes the client believing
	  you couldn't be healed more than 32K. [Skotlex]
	* Now you can use any skills (except encore/dancing ones) while under
	  Longing for Freeding. [Skotlex]
	* Now you can use any skills while under Marionette Control. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed npc_checknear's distance check returning the opposite of what it
	  should (false when the range is correct and viceversa) [Skotlex]
	* Added a warning on item loading when an item is of equippable type but
	  has no equippable position. [Skotlex]
	* Turning an alliance to an opposition won't work now during WoE [Skotlex]
	* Slaves can summon other mobs now. The only ones who can't do this are
	  player summoned mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Merged the following functions for faster processing of items: [Skotlex]
	  clif_storageitemlist + clif_storageequiplist = clif_storagelist
	  clif_guildstorageitemlist + clif_guildstorageequiplist = clif_guildstoragelist
	  clif_itemlist + clif_equiplist = clif_inventorylist
	  Note that the changes are a bit substantial and need proper testing!
	* Increased max knockback value support to 25. [Skotlex]
	* [Optimized]:
	  - buildin_npcshopitem memory allocation to calculate before reallocating.
	    [Lance]
	* Made guild member exp an unsigned int. [Skotlex]
	* Various cleanups to the npc clicking related functions. Should fix quite
	  some possible crashes from crafted packets. [Skotlex]
	* Added overflow checks for bonus settings mdef_rate/def_rate. [Skotlex]
	* Added missing update of INT after a buf.  [Skotlex]
	* Small cleanup of how SC_BLEEDING works. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed party_foreach_samemap invoking the function on the CASTER instead
	  of on the party members. [Skotlex]
	* Modified clif_parse_NpcClicked to handle the different situations with
	  different bl-objects (attack on players/mobs, click on npcs or mobs with
	  npc attached) [Skotlex]
2006/06/09
	* [Fixed]
	  - Compilation warnings on guild.c and int_guild.c [Lance]
	* Added structure party_data and party_member_data to the map server to
	  hold party-specific required information about parties including
	  Monk/TK/SG/SN states and party member count. Family information is still
	  missing, and handling of the state should probably be done by the
	  char-server, too... [Skotlex]
	* party Hp updates are no longer done each time the Hp is modified, but
	  together with the party xy timer. It means HP-bars will be a bit delayed
	  before being updated, but packet consumption should be much less during
	  heated battles. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed MoM's typo [Vicious]
	* Fixed map_readafm missing strcpy(afm_name, m->name). [Skotlex]
	* [Improved]:
	  - npc_click interception on BL_MOB and BL_PC to let sd act accordingly.
	    [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Execution of sleep/sleep2 more than once will hang the script_state.
	    [Lance]
	* Fixed @mapinfo displaying incorrectly maps with nosave which send you
	  back to your last savepoint. [Skotlex]
	* Moved guild_exp_rate from a mapserver battle config setting to a char
	  server config. It no longer modifies the total taxed exp as seen on the
	  guild information window, but directly modifies the exp that the guild
	  earns. [Skotlex]
	* Added an error report and correction when the map server receives a guild
	  from the char-server with more guild members than MAX_GUILD. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the interval between waterballs back to 125 [MasterOfMuppets]
	* Fixed a typo in char_sql/char.c, thanks to Euph [MasterOfMuppets]
2006/06/08
	* Modified guild exp to be an unsigned int rather than a signed one.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @skilltree printing out Unknown job for most targets used.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned clif_pvpset to not send the packet to nearby characters when the
	  source is GM-hidden. May help fix the crash on PvP with gm-hidden
	  characters. [Skotlex]
	* Modified map_freeblock_unlock so that aFree errors will report the
	  file/line that INVOKED the function rather than the function itself.
	  [Skotlex]
	  NOTE: Do NOT disable the memory manager as that will break this change.
	  This change is to be temporarily set until the afree'd error can be
	  resolved.
	* Updated mob_npc_warp to a three-state config switch. 0 disables. 1 enable
	  only on warps that don't lead to nobranch maps. 2 - enable on all warps.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted Don't Forget Me, Defender, Longing to use all val entries, and
	  to hold the speed adjustment value rather than speed penalty (eg: 125
	  instead of 25). [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up status_calc_speed so that speed penalties are correctly
	  handled (eg: 25% penalty is speed*100/75, not +speed*25/100). Thanks to
	  Euph for pointing it out and Belle for the speed mechanics. [Skotlex]
2006/06/07
	* Fixed Sense using mdef instead of mdef2 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed item-skills not showing up on login. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up clif_parseLoadEndAck, by testing which packets are required
	  only on first-login and which ones are required on all map-changes.
	  Skill-tree, Exp, Skill Points and most of the basic status are no longer
	  sent on map-change (items, cart data and zeny still need to be sent one
	  very  map-change). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the mob state not being set to Berserk/Angry correctly after the
	  mob reaches the target's location. [Skotlex]
	* Added config setting mob_npc_warp, when set to yes, enables mobs to be
	  warped between maps when stepping on a npc-warp. [Skotlex]
	* Added monster_ai setting &64, when enabled makes a mob run to any nearby
	  npc-warp when their current target has switched maps. [Skotlex]
	* Added pc_calcexp to calculate individual exp bonuses acquired from exp's
	  source (race bonus cards, SG Exp skills, pk-mode higher level exp) [Skotlex]
	* pc_gain_exp now also receives the source of the exp, when said source
	  exists, bonuses are applicated as needed. [Skotlex]
	* Added status_kill when capturing a mob, should take care of the mob not
	  respawning after caputed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed item info not displaying the found item id [Skotlex]
	* Fixed item info not displaying the weight value properly. [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted status resistances and durations taking as base Viccious's info
	  from the kro guidebook. [Skotlex]
	* Moved souldrain code from skill_counter_additional_effect to mob_dead. It
	  should display the skill animation correctly now. [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted several sc rate/time reductions as pointed out by Playtester.
	  [Skotlex]
	- Luk now plays a luk/10 reduction role rather than a luk/3 one.
	* Removed char_nick2id from char-sql server as it's no longer needed.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed quitting the map server not properly saving the storage before
	  deleting it. Thanks to Adam for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned status_get_sc_tick/status_get_sc_def to use the status_data
	  function. [Skotlex]
	* SC_STOP's chance and duration can't be reduced anymore. [Skotlex]
	* Storm Gust no longer has a 100% chance to freeze by passing mdef, now it
	  has a 300% base chance reduced by mdef and the like as explained out by
	  Tharis. [Skotlex]
	* Frost Diver/Frost Nova's base freezing chance is no longer affected by
	  target's int. [Skotlex]
	* [Improved]:
	  - mob_dead not to remove script controlled monsters with player sprites.
	  [Added]:
	  - buildin_mobdeadsit :D [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - temp++ gets issued before if(mvp_damage<(unsigned int)md->dmglog[i].dmg) in
	    mob_damage. Thanks to seahorsix. [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Corrected login-server SQL to use *((ulong *)p) instead of (ulong)p [Lance]
	* [Optimized]:
	  - list and size not being initialized (size get intialized in default: switch case)
	    Eliminated default case and initialized list and size at the beginning. [Lance]
2006/06/06
	* Hopefully fixed for sure mobs getting extra stats when changing-class due
	  to the mobs level up setting. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a piece of code that should no longer be needed due to the
	  combo-skill setting (inf = self, inf2 = no-target-self) which is blocking
	  self-skills from being used on others (pets/mobs should be allowed to do
	  that)  [Skotlex]
	* Added a status_check_skilluse call in Sightblaster to prevent it from
	  hitting hidden/cloaked/act-dead/etc players. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed firewall counter going down by 2 each hit rather than 1. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Soul Burn not zapping away all SP. [Skotlex]
	* The monsters can level up setting will not take effect when the mob's
	  level is LESS than their db counter-part (should prevent under-leveling
	  causing underflows and semi-immortal mobs) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mvp-exp calculations being messed up with more than one attacker.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Changed the mob exp race bonus so that each player gets their own bonus,
	  rather than the killer's bonus applying to everyone. Still not the
	  "correct" way, but one step closer to it. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Allocation of event_list in guild_npc_request_info to aCalloc so 
	    memcpy(ev->name,event,strlen(event)) will have a null terminator. [Lance]
2006/06/05
	* Fixed a crash when using SL_SMA and the "combo" ain't ready. [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed changing a mob's class causing them to get all sort of
	  stat bonuses due to the mobs-level-up setting. [Skotlex]
	* Changed hit, flee, cri, flee2, def2 and mdef2 to signed short, def, mdef
	  to signed char to correctly account for cards with penalties in said stats.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fog of Wall won't affect the caster now in any way. [Skotlex]
	* Added clif_fixpos packets before attacking for the first time to clear
	  any position sync issues with the client. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed skill_unitsetting using layout->count for the for instead of
	  group->count [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_INCDEXRATE/SC_INCAGIRATE. NPC_POWERUP/NPC_AGIUP now correctly
	  increase dex/agi by 40% per level. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed char-sql server not deleting character variables when deleting a
	  char. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected cloaking not ending on attack if you are near a wall. [Skotlex]
	* Updated pc_bonus to use cap_value on all status_data modifiers to prevent
	  overflows/underflows. [Skotlex]
2006/06/03
	* Fixed @mi/@mobinfo not showing the name collumns correcly [shadow]
	* Solved the bug that made firewalls only castable a few times until [MasterOfMuppets]
	  you relogged. Thanks to Euph for the fix.
	* Added variable other_mapserver_count to chrif.c which holds total count
	  of connected map-servers. By using this we prevent sending unnecessary
	  packets to the char-server when there's no more map-servers connected.
	  [Skotlex]
	- Affected packets are whispers, announces, party messages, guild messages.
2006/06/02
	* Fixed Visual Studio 7.1 Solution File (Login TXT and Map TXT were removed)
	* Fixed a bug in unit_can_reach_bl which breaks path seeking when the
	  target is near obstacles. [Skotlex]
	* Updated offensive use of Sanctuary to function like on the official servers [MasterOfMuppets]
	* Changed the interval between waterballs from 150 to 250 milliseconds [MasterOfMuppets]
	* Corrected clif_parse_takeitem to ALWAYS return a NAK packet when it
	  fails. Fixes cases where the client gets "stuck" and refuses to let you
	  pick any items. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the walk delay from firewall and changed its knockback [MasterOfMuppets]
	  to 1 tile to make it act more like in the official servers.
	* Some cleaning of the mob slave ai. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Brandish Spear to work on levels above 10. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Two-HandQuicken, One-HandQuicken to give 30 +2*lv% aspd-rate for
	  skill levels above 10 (meant for boss casted skills) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Spear-Quicken messing with the calc_flag [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Freeze/Stone/Benedictio not changing your elemental LEVEL to 1.
	  [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]
	  - Yet another compilation warning. [Lance]
2006/06/01
	* Altered status_calc_pc so that equipment scripts are ran before
	  card-scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_bonus to not underflow/overflow when adjusting def/mdef.
	  [Skotlex]
	- These two together, should fix Tao Gunka Card. 
	* npc_debug_warps() will now be invoked if warp_point_debug is set.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated item_db.sql/mob_db.sql to current. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed NPC_SELFDESTRUCTION not showing nor dealing damage. [Skotlex]
	* NPC_TRANSFORMATION/NPC_METAMORPHOSIS will now preserve the original mob
	  without removing it when the skill level is greater than one. [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_DANCING declaration in the Status Change tables to signal it
	  modifies Walk speed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_damage setting your canlog_tick even if the damage has no source
	  (eg: poison, berserk) [Skotlex]
	* Berserk's aspd bonus now stacks with other aspd bonuses, but is still
	  affected by Quagmire/Forget-me-not. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected setting slaves_inherit_mode to not apply to morphosis skills.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected pc_setoption to invoke status_calc_pc when getting/removing the
	  cart. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @mobinfo displaying the wrong element. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Autoblitz taking into account target's luck rather than attacker's
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed slaves warping endlessly to their master when the master-slave
	  distance exceeds 30. [Skotlex]
	* SC_ORCISH will now be dispelled on logout (if debufF_on_logout is set)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed attackrange/attackrange_ from TBL_PC, corrected clif.c using the
	  incorrect range variable. [Skotlex]
	* You can now equip/unequip stuff while the storage is open. [Skotlex]
2006/05/31
	* Fixed Soul Drain not really giving you SP [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Suppressed compilation warning in chrif.c [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Guys can't go across map-servers :( [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Restoration and saving of sd->npc_id must be done every time. [Lance]
	* Added back the Freeze/Petrify adjustments of -50%def and +25%mdef (when
	  where these lost?). Thanks to Buuyo for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the mob_ai&2 setting triggering rude-attacked due to can't walk
	  delay. [Skotlex]
	* Made the char_name_option char_athena.conf setting apply to parties and
	  guilds as well. It cannot be applied to pets yet without adding a
	  change-name-request interserver packet. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the JOB_* defines from map.h to mmo.h, update char.c to use them.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added function char_read_fame_list for famelist reading. Invoked it on
	  init, and made it be sent automatically to connecting map servers.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of the fame-list reading code. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of the fame-update code, fixed a logic bug which made the
	  ranking list fail to display the correct ranker names. [Skotlex]
	* Removed typedef bool from socket.h and included cbasetypes.c instead.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and corrected the calculation of hit/flee/cri/lucky dodge in
	  status_calc_bl. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Incorrect SQL syntax in login.c (missing collumn) [Lance]
	* [Improved]:
	  - SQL upgrade file for the new loginlog. Thanks to ultramage. [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - nullpo in pet.c caused by equipping without checking if the pet is available.
	    [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Latest client support completed! [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Missing #include for cbasetypes.h in login server SQL.
	  - Logic errors in run_script [Lance]
	* [Added]:
	  - Partial support for latest login packet. But it seems to have a new security
	    module. [Lance]
2006/05/30
	* [Improved]:
	  - Fake NPC interface to use real NPCs.
	  - Scripting interface to restore and save sd->npc_id. [Lance]
	* Added function pc_check_skilltree for checking if you unlocked new
	  tree-skills when raising non-passive skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed flee/hit calculation in status_calc_bl to account for bonuses from
	  the base status. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Compatibility problems in login.c [Lance]
	* Fixed pets ignoring can-act delays for skill usage. [Skotlex]
	* [Added]:
	  - Mercenary.c in VS.NET 2005 project files
	  [Improved]:
	  - loginlog using unsigned long `ip` field. 
	    (Please check for compatibility problems). [Lance]
	* Fixed status_calc_pc not zero'ing ALL vars it should, allowing certain
	  bonuses (like effect-on-hit) to stack. [Skotlex]
	* slaves inherit speed setting will now work regardless of whether the
	  slave or master has the MD_CANMOVE mode bit. [Skotlex]
	* Call Slave now invokes slaves on a 5x5 area around master. [Skotlex]
	* AL_TELEPORT will fail when used by slave mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Added NPC_ENERGYDRAIN, NPC_MENTALBREAKER to the list of undodgeable
	  attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status_damage not setting your HP to 0 when you died [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the pcbonus2 warnings using the wrong value before printing the
	  invalid Element error. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed underflow issues when calculating dmotion. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Absorb Spirit Spheres [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config min_chat_delay (default 0, battle/client.conf)
	  specifies in ms what is the min delay between player sent chats
	  (whisper/global/party/guild). Messages that exceed this threshold are
	  silently ignored for now (perhaps need to add a "DON'T SPAM" reply to the
	  player?) [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - signed/usigned problem in sprintf and fscanf @ mercenary.c [Lance]
	* Rewrote/cleaned up @petfriendly. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up final part of status_calc_pc (flags 2/4 do not exist) [Skotlex]
	* Updated attr_fix_table reading code to account for ELE_MAX (will
	  correctly read bigger elemental tables if ELE_MAX is changed) [Skotlex]
	* Aggressive mobs will now use battle_check_range rather than mob_can_reach
	  to decide whether to lock-on or not to a target within sight-range. [Skotlex]
	* Added warnings in mob_readdb when the mob's element is invalid. [Skotlex]
	* Added error messages in pc_bonus* functions when an invalid element is
	  passed to the relevant bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* [Optimized]:
	  - clif_specialeffect to use the enums.
	  [Improved]:
	  - buildin_specialeffect and buildin_specialeffect2 to accept effect area 
	    definition. [Lance]
	* [Added]:
	  - Visual Studio .NET 2003 includes for mercenary.c [Lance]
	* Removed the on-die specific code from unit_remove_map and placed it on
	  the corresponding *_dead functions. unit_remove_map should never assume the
	  char died, it is just a "remove from map" function. [Skotlex]
	* Updated status_damage to handle the general death code (clearing status
	  changes, clearing skill related data, sending death packet, etc). The
	  return value from the *_dead functions will tell it what to do or not with
	  the object (death aborted, clear it from map/memory, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up pc_dead to take advantage of the fact that status changes are
	  not ended until after the function. [Skotlex]
	* Disabled ontouch npcs triggering on hidden/chase-walk characters. 
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated/adapted current Homun code to use the status_data update.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated map-server Makefile to compile mercenary.* files. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Pets attacking even master is dead. [Lance]
	* Fixed battle_calc_weapon_attack damage capping damage to a minimum of 0
	  (negative values should be allowed when attack is absorbed by target's
	  element) [Skotlex]
2006/05/29
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Missing ';' in item #4358 [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Missing maps in map index database. [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Battle mechanics in battle_check_target [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Typo in mob_dead causing crash. Thanks to reddozen and his gang for testing.
	    [Lance]
	* Cleaned up friend list saving and fixed loading of friends.txt file
	  (char-txt) [Skotlex]
	* Added the Arunafeltz maps, not tested yet [Playtester]
	- someone with an up-to-date client should test them
	* Fixed pc_gainexp resetting your exp to 0 rather than adding it in...
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected aspd calculation code to avoid negative overflows. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed battle_check_target check on BCT_ALL to check versus BL_CHAR
	  instead of BL_PC and BL_MOB [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Declaration of int map_getcellp(struct map_data*,int,int,cell_t); [Lance]
	* Removed Undead being inmune to poison status. [Skotlex]
	* Removed speed penalty from SC_SKA [Skotlex]
	* Fixed SC_SPURT triggering on Soul Linkers. [Skotlex]
	* SC_DODGE won't be dispelled on death now. [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - pc_follow_timer possible triggering crash.
	  - pc_reg_received to use battle_status.hp instead of status.hp
	  [Added]:
	  - macro map_id2index for non-cyptic mapid to mapindex conversion. [Lance]
	* Added a division by zero check in mob_dead to prevent the (impossible)
	  case where a mob dies with received damage of zero. [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_get_range2 to return range 9 for skills with range 0 for
	  Non-Players. This usually signals Self skills, and mobs/pets should be able
	  to use them in other characters. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized a bit the SC_PROVOKE code (to use val3/val4) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed draining when the amount drained is negative (invoke zap rather
	  than heal) [Skotlex]
	* Implemented GS_FLING as per the current skill description. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_readparam/pc_setparam to use battle_status.hp/sp rather than
	  status.hp/sp, fixes scripts reading the wrong Hp/Sp values [Skotlex]
	* Added some missing SC_* entries on the initial listing (potion related
	  and speed up ones) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed function declaration of map_getcellp() [Skotlex]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - status.c:920: warning: 'mbl' might be used uninitialized in this function
	  - skill.c:6648: warning: 'matk_min' might be used uninitialized in this function
	  - skill.c:6648: warning: 'matk_max' might be used uninitialized in this function
	  - skill.c:2826: warning: 'sid' might be used uninitialized in this function [Lance]
	* [Optimized]:
	  - Removed unused variable (account_id) in storage_guild_storagesaved.
	* [Optimized]:
	  - Removed unused checks for unsigned data type and possible logic error for
	    char type (gcc treats char as unsigned). [Lance]
	* [Fixed]:
	  - Relogging in with 0 HP didn't trigger dead event. [Lance]
2006/05/28
	* Added functions status_revive, pc_revive and mob_revive to handle revival
	  (it doesn't handles player respawning, though). Fixed reviving @ commands.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_BLADESTOP to the skill enum at the beginning of status.c (fixes
	  Bladestop causing an unknown status change message). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed MSS_DEAD state skills not triggering. [Skotlex]
	* Changed undeads to by default always sustain 100% of the damage from firewalls [MasterOfMuppets] 
	* [Fixed]: 
	  - script functions that doesn't pass references, thanks to End_of_exam. [Lance]
	* [Protected]:
	  - clif_parse_LGMmessage from possible hacks [Lance]
	* Fixed unable to store n items into storage unless n was the total amount
	  of items you had. [Skotlex]
	* Suppressed compilation warnings (unsigned and signed mismatches) [Lance]
2006/05/27
	* Added structure status_data which holds status-related information (str,
	  agi, etc, speed, amotion, adelay, dmotion, weapon-damage, race, size, etc)
	  and weapon_atk structure with the weapon specific info (atk, atk2, element)
	  to be used by all combat structures (TODO: Homun needs to be updated to use
	  it). This in change involves a LOT of changes throughout the code and many
	  optimizations were done as well. Partial list (see svn changelog for complete
	  changes): [Skotlex]
	- NOTE: Changes are substantial! I tested a bunch of stuff and all the
	  skills I changed the most, but it is possible there are unnoticed bugs
	  remaining to fix!
	- Cleaned up TBL_PC, TBL_MOB, TBL_PC and mob_db structures to use status_data.
	- Split damage received functions into pc_damage/pc_dead and mob_damage/mob_dead
	- Added status functions to deal with damage and healing (status_damage,
	  status_heal, status_percent_change) and a bunch of defines for easier
	  handling of them (status_percent_heal, status_percent_damage,
	  status_fix_damage, status_kill, etc). Objects must be hurt/healed through
	  THIS, pc_damage/mob_damage most no longer be directly invoked!
	- Rewrote and cleaned up battle_calc_misc_attack
	- Merged config options pc_attack_attr_none, mob_attack_attr_none,
	  pet_attack_attr_none into attack_attr_none (type 4)
	- Removed config options player_defense_type, monster_defense_type,
	  pet_defense_type in favor of weapon_defense_type
	- Modified skill_calc_heal to take into account the MEDITATION bonus.
	- Modified Slim Pitcher so it will work when casted by non-players. Will
	  now also work with SP-healing items.
	- Rewrote Freedom of Cast code to use function status_freecast_switch to
	  switch adelay/speed when cast begins/ends.
	- Modified Magic Power to store amplified MATK/MATK2 in val3/val4 for
	  easier updating when used in conjunction with ground skills.
	- Fixed Asura Strike being usable from within a combo regardless of combo skill.
	- Added status_calc_bl which does status-change related calculations using
	  as base the base_status of the bl object and the SCB_* flag passed. This is
	  invoked on status changes, and status_calc_pc will no longer be invoked
	  (which results on much faster status-change calculations).
	- pc_clean_skilltree will now also remove item-granted skills.
	- Learning skills will now only invoke status_calc_pc when the skill is passive.
	- Cleaned up pc_check_base/job_lvup to only invoke the lv-up related
	  packets and functions ONCE regardless of skill-levls earned.
	- Cleaned up pc_ regen related functions.
	- Made player-sprite mobs have item pickup animation and walkdelay when taking items.
	- Clones will copy a player's base status rather than battle status (so
	  status-change alterations are not cloned)
2006/05/26
	* Part B of the homunculus code. [blackhole89]
	  While most of the homunculus handling functions are in now, it still lacks
	  code required for players to create it.
	  Given I haven't screwed up, you could master yourself one through the DB though.
	* Fixed crashing in mob.c [Lance]
	* Patches to allow everything to work right. + 1 more sample script. [Lance]
	* Mob control engine tested 99% working so far. [Lance]
	* Change scripting engine's NPC scope vars to dot (.) style.
	* Improved and (should be fully) fixed the mob control engine. [Lance]
	* Fixed typos in char.c [Lance]
	* Rewrote fame rank lists system to reduce char-server load, as requested by
	  Skotlex: now it has a copy of those lists, and updates only the proper one
	  when needed instead of rebuilding all from saves everytime (which required
	  to always save the character before rebuilding the lists) [DracoRPG]
	  - Note it hasn't been compiled nor tested with SQL, please do it for me
2006/05/25
	* Simplified ASC_BREAKER by making it a BF_WEAPON attack with an additional
	  int-based damage component (which is added right before elemental
	  modifiers) as described by AuronX. Pending further refining. [Skotlex]
	* Resolved differences between Stable/Trunk msg_athena.conf. [Lupus]
		Fixed atcommand @request MSG numbers accordinly.
		On adding new MSG strings, plzm reserve them in STABLE msg_athena.conf, too
	* Added NoVending mapflag. You may disable vending in the streets [Lupus]
	* Increased capacity for Account Variables to 64 [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Intravision implementation to that of stable's. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Login Server taking it's first argument as both login config
	  and lan config. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob control commands.
	* Fixed memory leak in scripts (again). Still have a few lying. [Lance]
2006/05/24
	* Fix to the slave AI problem. [erKURITA], by [Skotlex], reported by Niktout.
	* Item sharing now shares the same rules as exp sharing (no sharing when
	  dead, or idle, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed summoned slaves being able to cast onspawn summon-skills (slaves
	  aren't supposed to be able to call minions) [Skotlex]
	* The clif_skill_poseffect packet will not be invoked in Snap unless the
	  skill was successful. May fix the client-position lag. [Skotlex]
	* Merged item_db.sql from stable (the one from stable was more recent than
	  the one of trunk...) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected SL KA* spells not working on other Soul Linkers. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected a pair of incorrect sql query parsing logic in the login-sql
	  ban request packet. [Skotlex]
2006/05/23
	* Corrected mob angry mode, now it only "restores" itself after being hit
	  when the mob has no target within their range of sight rather than on
	  picking a new target. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed wedding sprite where it would stay active after unequipping. [Zido]
	* Some cleanup of run_script, should fix the memory leak there. [Skotlex]
	* the charname request hack message has been downgraded to only include
	  GM-invisible characters. [Skotlex]
	* corrected clif_charnameack to send negative ID when a disguised player
	  asks for it's own disguised name. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the disguised target-id checks taking into considering that
	  the only character that sees a negative ID is the same disguised character.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified battle_calc_weapon_attack to use new flags pdef/pdef (pierce
	  defense), Investigate and Icepick will now use the final def/vit-def values
	  rather than the base ones. [Skotlex]
	* The move-enable condition checks for skills are now checked for only when
	  on skill use, not at cast-end time. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected clif parse name request failing on disguised characters [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Soul Drain draining from all non-ground-based skills including
	  non-magic attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected pc_setoption to change the option and then change class.
	  changing option-wedding will automatically convert the view-class as well.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the 15% drop rate increase when killing higher level mobs in
	  pk-mode triggering for all mobs with lower level than yourself. Thanks to
	  Vayu. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed typo (this time it's not my fault) in script_reload() clearing the same
	  db each time o_o [Lance]
	* Fixed sleep command. [Lance]
	* Added 'setd' support for local NPC scope (') variables. [Lance]
	* [Scripting Engine Update] New variables are ready to be used. [Lance]
2006/05/22
	* Updated skill_delayfix to return 0 for mobs since they have no skill
	  delay other than the one specified in mob_skill_db [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the 20 lvl diff 15% exp bonus on pk_mode servers. Thanks to
	  Vayu for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* status_get_sc_tick will now use directly Stun's formula rather than
	  invoking the status sc chance once. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible null pointer in script command misc_effect [Skotlex]
	* Modified Investigate to take into consideration final def/vit-def rather
	  than base values for damage adjustment. [Skotlex]
	* WARNING: New scripting system contains memory leak
	  TODO: Free all scripts using script_free_code() instead of old methods. [Lance]
	* Excluded idle and auto-trade party members from TK_POWER list. [Lance]
	* Fixed compilation errors.
	  Tidy up jobmaster for easy debugging. [Lance]
2006/05/21
	* Part A of the Homunculus code.
	  This only features the structures, status_* and clif_* (packets) and is
	  not functional yet in any conventional way, but doesn't interfere
	  with present functionality either.
	  Main purpose is helping me to keep my work organized. [blackhole89]
	* Fixed the "fake" mute status bug. [Zido]
	* Speed up array size calculation and deletion. [Lance]
	* Player must learn the skill before doing auto-spell [Lance]
	* Exploit prevention in clif_parse_NpcStringInput [Lance]
	* SC_SPEARSQUICKEN -> SC_SPEARQUICKEN normalized enum name [Lupus]
	* Thanks to damirych & Falcon for [2006/04/30] STEAL skill [Lupus]
2006/05/20
	* grfio_final moved back if any of GRF overriding is enabled so servers
	  with such configuration will not have different values after reloading. [Lance]
	* jA1983 script.c buildin_menu fix. Thanks to End_of_exam. [Lance]
	* Abit of alterations to login-server. [Lance]
2006/05/19
	* Minor unsigned/signed alteration in pc_additem to shut the compiler up. [Lance]
	* Small change in pc_additem that could be fixing the current bug with new
	  items not getting added. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed loginlog definition in main.sql, thanks to Tempesta [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the mob-skill random picking behaviour causing infinite
	  loops sometimes. [Skotlex]
	* Modified mobskill_use behaviour to pick a random starting point and check
	  skills from that, rather than always checking from first to last. Fixes
	  skills with high priority blocking skills lower down in the list from
	  triggering. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob ai behaviour so that mobs use IDLE state skills when their
	  current target cannot be reached for melee fighting. [Skotlex]
2006/05/18
	* Added 5 config settings to adjust damage in pk-mode servers (misc.conf)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob_max_skilllvl being capped to 11! [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote/cleaned up several functions in storage.c [Skotlex]
	* Optimized pc_additem comparisons to account for items with more than four
	  slots. [Skotlex]
	* Updated clif.c to enable retrieval of items from cart/storage while
	  trading. Exception is retrieving items from the cart while vending.
	  [Skotlex]
	- The reasoning is that an ongoing trade will not get "corrupted" if you
	  earn items before it is commited (only if you lose items from your
	  inventory), and it is an annoyance when you realize the stuff you want to
	  trade is on the cart/storage.
	* skill reiteration code now does not checks for the trigger-area of the
	  skill in the case of non-players, which means mobs can now place traps in
	  cells adjacent to each other. [Skotlex]
	* Applied an experimental weather code that should lower bandwidth usage to
	  near-none, which's only disadvantage should be the weather not clearing out
	  until moving to another map (even when the mapflag is removed from the
	  current map). Please test and report if there's any anomalies with it.
	  [Skotlex]
	* NPC_AGIUP will now give movement boost of 50% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed WZ_WATERBALL number of hits when used by non-players. [Skotlex]
	* MO_BODYRELOCATION will send the slide packet with the actual src's
	  coordinates rather than selected tile. [Skotlex]
2006/05/17
	* Modified mob_can_changetarget to return true always when the new target
	  is the provoked-by character. Fixes provoke not making the mob change
	  target when it already is locked on another player. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to clear previous skill when combo time ends. Should fix TK
	  Rankers being unable to initiate a combo with the same kick their previous
	  combo was finished with. [Skotlex]
	* Power Up and Agi Up now increase Hit/Flee by 20%/lv [Skotlex]
2006/05/16
	* Modified "hide woe damage" to send the number of hits rather than 1 as
	  damage Because when the damage is less than the number of hits, the client
	  will display MISS. [Skotlex]
	* Fire Pillar will now do 200%MATK damage per hit when level is >10.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Blood Drain always hits now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Mob Area Skills not updating their use-time (rendering their skill
	  delay useless) [Skotlex]
	* Search free cell will now skip picking the center-tile as target
	  location. Will prevent slaves from walking on top of their master, or mobs
	  placing stuff right under themselves with the "around" target conditions
	  among other things. [Skotlex]
2006/05/15
	* Small changes to the skill.conf
	- Monsters now can place ground skills on top of each other by default
	- Land_Skill_Limit format changed and set to "Only Players" by default
	* When reading mapflags, when a map is set to be pvp or gvg, the other will
	  be turned off (disables pvp mapflags in gvg maps for pk-servers) [Skotlex]
	* Firepillar's damage per hit is now 100% MATK (rather than 20%) when the
	  skill level is above 10. [Skotlex]
	* Sorted out the item_data structure, getiteminfo should work correctly
	  now. [Skotlex]
	* KA* skills can now be casted on other Soul Linkers as well without the
	  Spirit requirement. [Skotlex]
	* Soul Drain will now show the SP drained regardless of drain display
	  settings. [Skotlex]
	* SC_COMBO state will now end in skill_attack rather than
	  skill_check_condition (as it is required there to apply damage bonuses
	  based on combo-casted skills) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Option_Wedding in const.txt (0x1000 won't work, it has to be 4096)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the nocast flag 2 (not usable in pvp) returning true in pk-mode
	  servers. [Skotlex]
	* When removing a castle's owning guild, the char servers will erase the
	  guardian data now. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the behaviour of immobile mobs when they can't chase their
	  target. Rather than using a longrange skill and then unlocking, they will
	  use an attack/angry state skill and then unlock. [Skotlex]
	* Some adjustments of how disguising + gm-hiding work together. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_GlobalMessage being the exact same function as clif_message
	  (the first should send to ALL_CLIENT and the later should send to
	  AREA_CHAT_WOS). Should fix globalmes script command. [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_BLADESTOP to the switch listing in status_change_start [Skotlex]
	* Characters in vending are now always considered "idle" if the
	  idle_no_share setting is active. [Skotlex]
	* Players with OPTION_INVISIBLE should not be sent to clients. [Lance]
	* Remaining fixes for item scripts. [Lance]
	* Added NPC event deprecated warnings to ease debugging old scripts. [Lance]

2006/05/12
	* Supplied fake NPC ID in sd->npc_id for item scripts. [Lance]
	* Bugfix on fake npc [Lance]
	* Fixed mob_once_spawn not working for non-random coordinates. [blackhole89]
	* Reverted again the change that stuns the caster on Ske, Ska, Swoo when
	  the target is a nonplayer (rather than always) [Skotlex]
	* Modified mob_spawn_once so that coordinates -1,-1 are "random around the
	  player" while 0,0 are random around the whole map (regardless of whether
	  there's a player attached or not) [Skotlex]
	* Knockback will no longer work on traps during woe. [Skotlex]
2006/05/11
	* Fixed the definition of the KEY in the loginlog, thanks to TheUltraMage
	  [Skotlex]
	* NPC_POWERUP and NPC_AGIUP now cause a increase in hit/flee (respectively)
	  of 40% per level. [Skotlex]
	* Changed a bit the MAX_ZENY checks in trade.c to prevent overflows.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote npc_selllist for a more proper-clean implementation. [Skotlex]
	* Increased NPC_POWERUP's dex bonus to +25*lv [Skotlex]
	* Moved TK_DOWNKICK's stun time from time to time2 [Skotlex]
	* Added TK_TURNKICK's stun to splash-pushed mobs. Duration is 2secs (time2)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Merged the code for Ska, Ske, Swoo together. Swoo stun duration is now 10
	  secs (reducable) if you target a mob that already has Swoo active. [Skotlex]
	* Added the missing semi-comma from the upgrade_svn6533.sql file. Thanks to
	  Tanaous [Skotlex]
	* Added back the missing code that substracts arrows when normal-attacking.
	  [Skotlex]
2006/05/10
	* Changed the state of Asura back to explosionspirits, added a hardcoded
	  move_enable check when invoking Asura and NOT while in BladeStop or a
	  Combo. [Skotlex]
	* Added back SC_XMAS to status.c, it got lost sometime during all the
	  previous reworkings. [Skotlex]
	* Changed wedding costumes to use setoption rather than changebase.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified setoption so that flag 1 or no flag adds an option, and flag 0
	  removes it. [Skotlex]
	* Updated script_commands with the new behaviour. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_db2.txt and mob_db2.sql to have only 10 drop slots rather
	  than 15. [Skotlex]
	* Users are now able to use their own dnsbl servers (login_athena) [Zido]

2006/05/09
	* Rewrote/cleaned up trade.c for a more clean trading implementation.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added @request commands, sends a request to all connected GMs of
	  lowest_gm_level or above as a whisper message. Defaults to gm level 20
	  users (UNTESTED). [Skotlex]
	* Modified @commands to use Meruru's code which is faster and does a fair
	  attempt at tabulating the commands presented. [Skotlex]
	* Updated SKA to return a random value between 0 and 99 each time
	  status_get_def is invoked. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Making Arrow to not include unidentified items in the list.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Reduced drop slots from 15 to 10. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob_db.sql with the current data. [Skotlex]
	* Updated setoption script command to receive a second (optional) argument
	  flag. If the flag is 1, the option is added to what the player currently
	  has; likewise using flag 2 removes only that option. No flag (or any other
	  value) is the older behaviour of removing all other options and setting
	  specificly what is passed. [Skotlex]
	* Updated script_commands information for setoption due to this change.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Small fix in npc-created chat rooms to properly include the terminating 0
	  on the chat's event. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Fog of Wall's symmetry in respect to Misc attacks, they no longer
	  get reduced by 50% regardless of who is standing on the fog. [Skotlex]
	* monster_ai&2 will now trigger the rude-attacked skill when the mob can't
	  move and the attacker is out of it's attack range. [Skotlex]
	* Added missing icon for Joint Beat [Skotlex]
	* Mob-search functions will now skip enemies with no exp/job_exp. [Skotlex]
	* Treasure chests will now be excluded from the mob-drop listings
	  (@whodrops) [Skotlex]
	* Fix on pc_skill which fixes overlapping when one gets more than one bonus
	  for the same skill. [Skotlex]
	* Updated main.sql's loginlog table structure. [Skotlex]
	* Added svn_update6533.sql to update the loginlog structure as suggested by
	  theultramage. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up somewhat the implementation of BladeStop. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the head_bottom (pet-armor) position in packet 0x22c (walk packet)
	  when crafted for non-players. [Skotlex]
	* Script commands sc_start, sc_start2 and sc_start4 will now start
	  regardless of sc defense of the target player (that is, they cannot be
	  avoided/blocked) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible counter overflow in attacked_count, changed the var size
	  to unsigned char since the code can handle the overflow now. [Skotlex]
	* Multiple targets again reduces armor defense, as reported by Tharis.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Increased dex bonus of NPC_POWERUP to +20 per level. [Skotlex]
	* Fog of Wall's -50 hit reduction is now only for ranged attacks. [Skotlex]
2006/05/08
	* Reverted the change that was making ES skills stun the caster always.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed the fixpos packet which is sent whenever you are hit while moving
	  as Aegis doesn't sends this packet neither. [Skotlex]
	* ES magic will now put the caster on stun for 0.5 secs regardless of
	  whether the skill-target is a mob or not. [Skotlex]
	* Added function clif_party_join_info which sends packet 0x1e9 each time a
	  party-member joins. This packet (as redundant info as it has) should also
	  contain the field for "adoptability", but that needs to be coded in yet.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added clif_ParseAdoptRequest which does the basic adoption handling. More
	  checks and the reply packets still need to be coded in. [Skotlex]
	* Happy State and TK stances won't dispel on death now. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up combo-skill implementation, SC_COMBO is automatically ended in
	  skill_check_condition now. [Skotlex]
	* Modified TK-ranker infinite combos to behave as described by AuronX.
	  Refer to his thread in the development section for details. [Skotlex] 
	* Made all Soul Link Spirit skills not be castable on self. [Skotlex]
	* Changed rate of NPC status effect skills to 50+10*lv% base chance
	  (guessed, but better than 100% for all levels) [Skotlex]
	* Changed max level of NPC status effect skills to 5 [Skotlex]
	* Increased max number of tries to find a random spot in maps to 1000 since
	  some maps have so many non-walkable tiles it's hard to find one in just 100
	  tries. [Skotlex]
	* status_set_viewdata will remove the Wedding Option status when you set a
	  class that is not wedding.  [Skotlex]
	* hide_gvg_damage will now send 1 instead of -1 as damage. [Skotlex]
	* idletime will now be updated on attack-request, not on sit/standup
	  [Skotlex]
	* Party members sitting will no longer be considered idle. [Skotlex]
	* Removed SP_DISGUISE from the bonus list (onequip/onunequip should be used
	  with the disguise/undisguise script commands instead). [Skotlex]
	* Moved Sharp Shooting display to the block with Auto-Counter (since that's
	  the other skill that can show critical as well) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected some fields in the standing still packet (guild emblem being
	  stored as a Long when it should be Short) [Skotlex]
	* Modified most fields of view_data to be unsigned shorts rather than
	  signed ones. [Skotlex]
	* On-Touch NPCs will now make you stop walking when you trigger them.
	  [Skotlex]
	* ShadowJump/JumpKick will make you land on the target's cell now.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Kaahi triggering only once per skill duration. [Skotlex]
2006/05/07
	* Fixed readme/changelog.html [KillerBox]
	* Removed old logs. [Lupus]
	TODO: 1. Add produce logging into PICKLOG 2. Replace map names with map index
2006/05/05
	* Optimized clif.c clif_scriptmenu/input/inputstr to check for sd->state.using_fake_npc
	  before sending one (as it's not required to send twice).
	* Reinitialize sd->state.using_fake_npc in clif_parse_LoadEndAck (for scripts that warps
	  players and still continues execution to work). [Lance]
	* Updated item_db.sql to current. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in @commands, most likely the reason some people were still
	  getting crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @commands not showing the last available commands (unless the total
	  amount of commands is divisible by ten) [Skotlex]
	* Added a npc-script-event cache to avoid looking up event-scripts every
	  time they need to be executed. Events cached are all those defined in
	  script_config (on login, logout, mapchange, death, kill, level up) [Skotlex]
	- Since the cache holds direct pointers to the npcs/events, do NOT unload
	  the related NPCs or you'll get dangling pointer crashes. However,
	  @reloadscript will work fine.
	- Set the etc_log to on to see a summary of npcs/events loaded for script
	  execution on startup.
	* The Rest bonus activated by using /doridori while in rest should now
	  trigger with all the class tree (TK/SL/SG) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Kaupe always triggering when the one who was under Kaupe was a
	  player rather than the one attacking... [Skotlex]
	* /doridori now won't double the HP/SP regen of TKs, it only activates
	  their "happy" state. [Skotlex]
	* Added the -50 hit penalty when standing on Wall of Fog. [Skotlex]
	* Uncommented the status_calc_mdef2 call in status_calc_pc. [Skotlex]
	* Being in Enjoyable Rest state will now also trigger the HP/SP Time skills
	  (even if there's no other TK around). [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config settings view_range_rate and chase_range_rate to
	  adjust the view-range and chase-range (range2/range3) of the mob_db without
	  having to manually change them (battle/monster.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Kaupe now will only block all skills of players, for non-players, only
	  normal attacks can be missed. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the Kaite spell-reflect code after the damage calculation function,
	  so the reflected damage is exactly the damage the original target would
	  have received. Will only trigger if the damage to be reflected is above 0.
	  [Skotlex]
	* OnEquip scripts will now trigger on log-on. [Skotlex]
	* Infinite Endure will no longer give mdef bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Removed bInfiniteEndure bonus, Eddga card now uses onequip/onunequip to
	  start/end infinite endure. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Kaahi's SP cost per heal. [Skotlex]
	* Now when walkdelay is set to 0, characters will stop walking when hit,
	  but will not have any walk delay. (previously setting walk delay to 0 would
	  not even stop characters from walking when hit) [Skotlex]
2006/05/04
	* Some people think its sexy to declare variables after blocks of code. Fixed. [Zido]
	* Fixed a possible infinite loop in skill_clear_unit_group [Skotlex]
	* Some clean-ups in the mob_ai [Skotlex]
	* Improved atcommand autoloot, now displays droprate in percents and notices
	  player if autoloot is already on or off. Also simplified the code [Harbin, Kain],
	  commited by erKURITA
	* Added one grace range in the mob_loot search function which should fix
	  mob_can_reach failing when invoked with the same distance that distance_bl
	  returned. [Skotlex]
	* Stun time for using ES magic on non-mobs reduced to 0.5 secs. [Skotlex]
	* Eska is now usable on bosses. [Skotlex]
	* Swoo will stun you if attempted on an already 'swooned' enemy. [Skotlex]
	* clif_skill_failed will print out a debug line with the skill_id (since
	  the current null_po does not helps at all to fix it) [Skotlex]
	* Applied TheUltraMage's suggested fixes to the grfio module. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote Kaahi to behave as it should. It will heal whatever amount of
	  damage accumulates in the time2 interval (500ms by default) after being
	  hit. [Skotlex]
	* Changed skill_unit_move_unit_group to enable moving of all types of
	  ground-skills except ensembles (fixes warmth not following you) [Skotlex]
2006/05/03
	* Kaahi now triggers every 500ms rather than on every hit (but it only
	  heals if in those 500ms an attack that would previously trigger Kaahi has
	  taken effect). In other words, it works just like before, except damage
	  gets "buffered" into 500ms slots. [Skotlex]
	* Kaite, Kaute will now show a skill effect when they trigger. [Skotlex
	* Knowledge will now only trigger if you logon to the memorized map, not
	  walk into it. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected @whomap directly invoking msg_table[] rather than msg_txt()
	  [Skotlex]
	* Guessed where the pet data goes in spawn packet 0x7c. This may be wrong
	  and not fix the pet issue, but I doubt it'll cause any problems that won't
	  be fixed by making the pet move. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Charge Attack's state from none to move_enable. [Skotlex]
	* Made tomahawk an NPC_SKILL so that it may not be plagiarized. [Skotlex]
2006/05/02
	* Fixed standing up not really standing you up. [Skotlex]
	* Moved battle_consume_ammo to the end of skill_castend_damage_id,
	  skill_castend_nodamage_id and skill_castend_pos2 rather than
	  battle_calc_weapon_attack. They will trigger when the player's arrow_atk
	  state is active and a ground skill was not invoked. It should fix all
	  issues with splash/ground skills consuming ammo per target rather than once
	  per skill use. [Skotlex]
	* Added structure state to the ground skills, their fields are magic_power,
	  into_abyss and ammo_consume to indicate the states that were previously
	  stored in val3. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented desperado as explained by Rockman-EXE. The skill-effect is
	  not showing up though, I'll need some logged packets to see what's missing.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Removed the unit_can_move checks in skill cast-end, they should be
	  performed in skill_check_require when the skill's state is move_enabled.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Changed extremity fist's state to move_enabled, the explosion spirits
	  check is now hardcoded. [Skotlex]
	* Absorb Spirit Sphere now gives +10SP per sphere as per discussions with
	  Haplo. [Skotlex]
	* Changed a <= into a < in pc_steal_item. This means drops with 0.01% are
	  impossible to steal unless you have at least 100% steal-rate (where steal
	  rate is dex - opponent dex + skill_lv*3% + 10%) [Skotlex[
	* Cleaned up clif_parse_action_request to enable sitting/standing while in
	  shops, interacting with npcs, etc. [Skotlex]
	* Kaite now works against all types of spells. [Skotlex]
	* Kaupe now works against all skills. [Skotlex]
	* Sanctuary now won't damage non-enemies. [Skotlex]
	* Blessing now will always give you bonus stats even if you are wearing
	  undead armor. [Skotlex]
	* Modified how Rogue's treasure works so that you get +1% to your steal
	  rate rather than +0.01% to the final rate. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote Warmth to use ground-skill-units, it should behave now like in
	  officials (implementation is not quite the same, but it should yield the
	  same effects while consuming less bandwidth). "Stacking", as it's called,
	  is possible now, but limited to eA's minimum timer skill interval (100ms).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Modified NPC_POWERUP so that it gives +10 dex * skill level rather than
	  +5+lv to all stats (as explained by Playtester and Tharis on how the skill
	  behaves). [Skotlex]
	* Allowed SG_FEEL memorizing the same map for all three. [Skotlex]
	* SC_FUSION won't end when you die now. [Skotlex]
2006/05/01
	* Added knockback when you run into a wall during running. However
	  position is not being refreshed on the client yet... [Skotlex]
	* Fixed pc_disguise not allowing you to "redisguise". [Skotlex]
	* Corrected a crash when sd is null in npc_event [Skotlex]
	* After testing to make sure it works properly, I'm including
	  new battle conf options to limit MVP drops. [Reddozen]
	* Removed OPTION_XMAS, it seems to not exist.... [Skotlex]
	* Added SC_SMA to handle "ready to use SMA" status (rather than SC_COMBO)
	  since it has a visual effect to use. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the value of OPTION_FLYING [Skotlex]
	* Using SG_FUSION ends Soul Linked effect. [Skotlex]
	* status_setviewdata will set your option accordingly when the previous/new
	  view-class is wedding or xmas suit. [Skotlex]
	* Added function map_foreachinshootrange, behaves the same way as
	  map_foreachinrange, but it also performs a "shoot-path" check before
	  invoking the function. Used in the skill subtimer function if
	  skill_wall_check is defined. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed AL_WARP displaying "Unknown Area" selections when you don't have
	  all memo points used up. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed alive_count not being reset on skill unitsetting, which leads to
	  some groups not being cleared once all their units expire. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized Kaahi/Kahai, will now only show the amount of HP healed. Moved
	  to skill_counter additional effect so it may trigger even on miss. [Skotlex]
	* SKA no longer blocks skills. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized fake npc system. Added npc_checknear back to npc_buysellsel. [Lance]
