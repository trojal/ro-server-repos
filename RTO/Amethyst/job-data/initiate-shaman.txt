		note:
		i don't know what effect to use, use a placeholder for now unless you have an idea.

	SP damage.  Once the spell is cast the shaman will unleash three spirit balls a second until all 
	have been released. The shaman is unable to move or take any other action while the balls are 
	being unleashed.  If the shaman sustains damage of any kind while unleashing the balls, the spell 
	stops and the firing is interupted.  The recharge time does not begin until after the spell is

	[ Skill Lv * 2 ] spirits are spawned that attack any enemy in sight.  When these smaller spirits 
	die, they explode violently - dealing damage to whatever is near them.  
		note :
		spirits have 1 hp, but their exploding death will do (INT / 100 * 2000) ghost 
		property damage	to enemies within 2 cells <5x5 square> of the spirit.  the 
		spirits will die anyways after 20 seconds, exploding of course.
		sprites : 
			large ghost = giant whisper
			exploding spirits = horong
			explosion itself = napalm beat visual

Blackhole - Offensive - 10 Lv's - Requires : Spirit Well Lv 10, Ghostgrave Lv 5, Doom Lv 5
spell	SP : 100	Cast : 10 s.	Recharge : n/a		Duration : 15 s.
	Catalyst : 1x Blue Gemstone, 1x Red Gemstone, 1x Yellow Gemstone
	Conjure forth a menacing black sphere that occupies one cell (1x1).  Any enemy that steps 
	within 2 cells (5x5) of the sphere will cause the sphere to implode violently, dealing [ ( Base Level 
	+ Int + Vit ) * Skill Lv * 5 ] of defense ignoring ghost property damage to each enemy in the 
	5x5 area.  The shaman can only create a single blackhole at a time.  If the 15 second duration of 
	the spell runs out, the blackhole explodes in a shockwave, dealing [ ( 400 + Base Lv ) * Skill Lv * 
	2 ] ghost property damage to any enemy within 5 cells (11x11) of the black sphere's location.  
	The black sphere is considered a trap, and therefore cannot harm or affect the Shaman or his 
	allies.
		note :
		i do not know what sprite or effect could be used for this, so if you can't find one
		or don't want to, just use a placeholder of some kind.  also, by defense ignoring, it
		means the damage will ignore reductions from race or resistance, but not amplifications
		from race or resistance.  in other words, this ghost property damage will do 100% of its
		capacity to neutral property 1, instead of 25%, but will do 125-200% to undead property
		targets - depending on their property level.		

Soul Pact - Defensive - 1 Lv - Requires : Channeling Lv 1, Communing Lv 7
spell	SP : 150	Cast : 3 s.	Recharge : n/a		Duration : 10 s.
	For 10 seconds, if you recieve damage that would kill you, you instead drop to 1 HP and one of 
	your summoned ghosts dies instead.  For each ghost that dies in this manner, you lose 50% of 
	your SP.  If you have no SP left at this time you will die anyways.

Channeling - Passive - 1 Lv - <QUEST SKILL>
n/a	Ghosts you summon no longer vanish when exposed to daylight, but your maximum SP is 
	lowered 7% for each summoned ghost under your control.  Yes, this really is worth it.
	[ the exploding spirits from Ghostgrave do not count, but the large one does ]
