	( The damage from this spell is also useful for healing your undead minions )
		note: 
		ideally, a black-tinted shockwave visual would be best.  but i do not know if there is one.

	target enemy, dealing [ Skill Lv * Vit + 50 ]% of your Matk as shadow property damage to them 
	and anything adjacent to them (3x3).  ( This skill is extremely useful to damage a single target 
	that's being mobbed by your own minions! )
		note:
		there should be a darkness-based soul strike that a couple of bosses use in there somewhere.
		it's like normal soul strike, but black.  use that visual.

	damage.  ( Just like Firewall. Use this to create a barrier between your opponents and your 
	minions. )
		note:
		i do not think there is a visual in the game that could be used for this, therefore it would
		be good to extract the firewall visuals and grayscale them, then darken them.
